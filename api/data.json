But strictly speaking, Qiqi has never been awakened.<br/>As such, she counts as a very rare case of a zombie that gives itself orders.<br/>If these orders are simple ones like \\\"defeat the enemy,\\\" Qiqi has no problem fulfilling them.<br/>But when faced with complex instructions such as \\\"go to Jueyun Karst, climb the sheer rock faces and pick herbs,\\\" Qiqi sometimes winds up stuck below the cliffs, unable to give up no matter how many times she tries and fails to scale the cliff.<br/>The method to cancel her orders is very simple — hug Qiqi from behind, tell her something like \\\"I love you the most,\\\" and the orders will dissipate, just like that.<br/>Unfortunately, there's just no element of sincerity when Baizhu does it, leading to greatly reduced results.<br/>Perhaps someday, someone will come along who understands that such words cannot be spoken lightly, and who slowly but carefully releases the hold that Qiqi's orders have over her...<br/>What will Qiqi's response be then?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"This ancient story has long been forgotten by mortals.<br/>An ordinary herb-picking lass named Qiqi lost her way and trespassed the realm of the adepti. Injuring her right leg in a fall, she hurriedly hid in a cavern to rest.<br/>Even occupied as she was in bandaging her wound, she could hear sounds that did not belong to the mortal plane. But she could have never expected that with a huge crash, she would forever be trapped between life and death.<br/>Whether adepti or demons, just or wicked, all understood that she was an innocent mortal caught in the crossfire.<br/>Or perhaps it was by the will of heaven that she received a Vision in her dying moments, and so ended this contention between adepti and demon.<br/>The adepti could not bear to let her die, and each imparted to her a portion of their strength, meaning to breathe life back into her body.<br/>Qiqi did indeed awaken and live again, but went into a berserk state, unable to control the adepti energy raging through her.<br/>Seeking to end the disturbance, Mountain Shaper had no choice but to seal the hapless maiden in amber.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"After hundreds of years, Qiqi was discovered by humans, still trapped in the amber, and was brought to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for burial.<br/>The mountain roads were treacherous, however, and the amber was bumped about. Coupled with the passing of many years, the seal on Qiqi was all but spent.<br/>She awakened in the middle of the night, broke the amber in secret, and fled.<br/>Following the herb-picking habits of her previous life, Qiqi headed right for the hills.<br/>By chance, she met Baizhu, the boss of Bubu Pharmacy, on the way, and he took her in.<br/>Now, Baizhu was a doctor of great skill, but he was hardly a man of high caliber or great courage.<br/>Even so, he took her in, never mind that her memory was so poor that she could not even sort herbs out.<br/>It does seem that his acceptance of Qiqi has something to do with his own personal pursuits.<br/>Qiqi is stiff, but not slow, and has long realized this. However, she does not take it to heart.<br/>Perhaps she has seen too much, or been alone for too long... But what remains true is that she treasures his concern, even if there is some other motive behind it.\"},{\"title\":\"A Home-and-Away Handbook of Practical Wisdom for the Undead\",\"desc\":\"Qiqi carries something with her that looks like a notebook.<br/>Qiqi's memory is very poor, so it is an object of irreplaceable importance if she is to smoothly go about her daily life.<br/>The words within are written in a centuries-old style, and are very elegant indeed.<br/>The first page is an instructional on calisthenics.<br/>Moving past that, one finds the descriptions of various herbs and some \\\"orders.\\\"<br/>Qiqi needs to give herself orders, so she has very precise instructions to ensure smooth transition.<br/>She has also dutifully written down all the things she needs to do in a day.<br/>Recently, she has also added a section on \\\"brain training\\\" and \\\"mnemonic methods.\\\"<br/>At this point, it has become a true \\\"dummy's guide\\\" on just about anything.<br/>But if the day ever comes when Qiqi also forgets to look at her notebook... there would truly be nothing for it then.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Qiqi's Vision was given to her in the last moment of her life.<br/>She wanted to stop the clock from turning. She wanted to live happily again.<br/>She feared death. She wanted to live. She missed her family... These feelings coalesced at last into \\\"ice.\\\"<br/>\\\"If only I could freeze time... How wonderful would that be?\\\"<br/>As she thought thus, tears fell from the moribund girl's eyes upon the Vision that had appeared before her.<br/>The mighty and illuminated adepti all acknowledged this as a legitimate form of \\\"illumination\\\" — the yearning of humanity for bygone days is, after all, a desire to protect that past.\"}]}\n",

In addition to her elegance and charm, Lisa is also highly educated.<br/>She is said to have been the most talented sorceress to study at the Sumeru Academia in the last two centuries.<br/>It is known that Lisa chose to return to Mondstadt after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Lisa is tasked with managing and maintaining the vast collection of books in the Knights of Favonius library, as well as ensuring that their potions are always fully stocked.<br/>The only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.<br/>In both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.<br/>At times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.<br/>Nevertheless, it appears that she performs every task flawlessly, as her work consistently stands up to scrutiny.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"The fact that Cyrus of the Sumeru Academia frequently refers to Lisa as their \\\"best student in two hundred years\\\" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.<br/>From outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.<br/>This, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.<br/>That is, provided they go and see her at an acceptable hour.<br/>To visit during unacceptable hours — such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea — can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"When people meet Lisa for the first time, they often find themselves overawed by the famous alumnus of Sumeru Academia.<br/>However, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.<br/>By negotiating with Kaeya, she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to Huffman and Swan, and had Flora start sending Donna over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.<br/>The only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.<br/>This is the one area where Lisa feels more comfortable handling the work herself rather than delegating it.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"When Lisa first joined the Knights of Favonius, the Grand Master sought to appoint her as Captain of the 8th Company.<br/>This was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, Nymph, who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.<br/>At Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.<br/>Two minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that \\\"Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role.\\\"<br/>For the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.<br/>Eventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.<br/>Undoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.<br/>To be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload — and that is something that she would never be able to accept.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Having personally witnessed raving-mad scholars in the forests of Sumeru and powerful sages sitting underutilized on advisory councils, Lisa realized what uninhibited erudition can really do to a person.<br/>It seemed such a high price to pay... How much did one have to sacrifice to attain the profoundest knowledge of all?<br/>Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.<br/>Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.<br/>\\\"Before demanding too many miracles from the gods, first consider if you are willing to pay the price they ask.\\\"<br/>These words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.\"},{\"title\":\"Special Heating Cauldron\",\"desc\":\"The Special Heating Cauldron is a purpose-built cauldron made to a design that no one in Mondstadt could understand. It features time-delay heating, semi-automated ingredient insertion, and temperature regulation functions.<br/>Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.<br/>She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.<br/>But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.<br/>After all, a relaxing afternoon tea session is by far the most important part of Lisa's day.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"A Vision is a sign from the gods: a sign that you are one of those whom they have chosen to change the world.<br/>Or, maybe it's just one of the many hoops that one has to jump through on the path to unearthing the secrets of magecraft.<br/>After all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.<br/>\\\"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\\\"<br/>And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.<br/>With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.<br/>For whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.<br/>The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.<br/>So, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.<br/>Perhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions.\"}]}\n",

She was fostered from a young age by the Kujou Clan and has served since then as part of the Tenryou Commission.<br/>The Tenryou Commission is one arm of the Tri-Commission, and is in charge of the security of Inazuma. Today, Sara is a general of the Tenryou Commission, and hers is the vital task of maintaining order within Inazuma City itself.<br/>She governs well and is ever determined to set a good example for her subordinates. No matter how tough the issue, if it falls under the Tenryou Commission's jurisdiction, Sara can solve it in good time.<br/>Sara smiles little and is swift and resolute in the pursuit of her missions, and so many Inazumans consider her an inaccessible, stone-cold military person.<br/>However, such an assessment might be too surface-level for someone like Sara, who seems cool on the outside but burns within.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"In Inazuma, the Vision Hunt Decree is the manifestation of the Raiden Shogun's will to pursue Eternity, and Sara is the main enforcer of that decree.<br/>Sara believes that Visions, in the hands of those with incorrectly-aligned minds, will destabilize the foundations of Inazuma, thus necessitating the Vision Hunt Decree.<br/>However, this does not mean that Sara will stoop to any means necessary to enforce it.<br/>When citizens are inevitably affected as the decree is carried out, she will expend the utmost patience and sincerity to attempt to explain the Almighty Shogun's long-term goals.<br/>She has also given clear orders forbidding the harming or exploiting of civilians during the pursuit of the decree, as such evil deeds will only drag the great name of the Archon through the mud.<br/>Unfortunately, the vast ideals of the Archon are too great for mortals to perceive, and resentment arises nonetheless, with some even uniting to resist those who enforce the decree.<br/>In such circumstances, where she has no choice but to take action, Sara often sighs helplessly before facing the enemy.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"The Shogun's Army has Kujou Sara's leadership to thank in large part for the fearlessness and unity of its soldiery.<br/>Surveying battle lines, setting up training plans, selecting weapons and armor... Unlike many generals who prefer to strategize and plan from the rear, Sara prefers to do such things herself.<br/>Sara is very harsh on herself during training, with her personal regimen being over ten times tougher than that which the ordinary troops go through. Even when night has fallen and the world has gone to sleep, one can still hear the sounds of her bow being drawn echoing through the dojo.<br/>On the battlefield, she has always been at the tip of the spear, leading the troops with absolute heroism and awe-inspiring fighting spirit.<br/>When the dust has settled, she will also personally see to the wounded, and give reward and mete out punishment based on merit. Every step of the battle that passes through her hands is managed well, with missteps being very few and far between.<br/>Sara's troops are all witnesses to her words and deeds. No one who has fought alongside her does not hold her in the highest regard.<br/>The general is the soul of the army, and fine generals are hard to find. Small wonder, then, that Sara has always been the pride of the Shogun's Army.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Even when she is not training, Sara brings her austere, strict nature into her daily life.<br/>Her life seems to follow some sort of eternal, unchanging rule. She wakes up on the dot, trains on the dot, eats a fixed amount...<br/>From things as large as training regimens to things as small as food consumption, Sara has her own perspective and pursues her self-created standards to the last letter.<br/>\\\"Miscellaneous objects are to be sorted by category, and furnishings are to be arrayed in straight lines. There is to neither be dirt in any corner, nor on the ground.\\\"<br/>These are the standards Sara holds her dwelling up to.<br/>She views excellence in such matters to also be a part of her training, and handles them herself, not requiring the aid of any servants.<br/>That said, how could her servants ever just stand idly by? Every time they meet Sara, they will implore her to put the cleaning cloth down and leave the matter to them.<br/>Having repeatedly declined their offers to no avail, Sara eventually took to cleaning up behind closed doors, posting up this sign outside her room—<br/>\\\"Training in Progress, Do Not Disturb.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Although she has grown up amongst humans, Sara still maintains the various habits of the tengu. When she leaves the Tenryou Commission Headquarters on occasion, it is mostly to go to the mountains.<br/>She knows them like the back of her hand, and has witnessed many strange creatures not often told of in human tales.<br/>Among them are many fierce and evil things, but there are also little creatures that mean no harm. To Sara, however, these are just differences in form.<br/>There was a time when a sizable spate of thefts was reported to the police station in quick succession, and they could not find the culprit. Walking through the woods on higher alert than usual, Sara quickly espied the bake-danuki running along hurriedly while carrying their plunder.<br/>Of course, bake-danuki are not evil by nature, but only steal food out of gluttony.<br/>Capturing the creatures, Sara had only this to say as she reclaimed their ill-gotten gains:<br/>\\\"Hiding in the mountains will not let you escape judgment. Listen closely, for this is your final warning. Do not make yourself a nuisance to civilians again, or else...\\\"<br/>The bake-danuki were chilled to the bone, nodding as they balled up in a corner. After this, they would keep to that agreement and did not again do such ill.<br/>As for the sharp-tongued Sara, she would bring various melons and fruits that could keep for a longer period up to the mountains while training there, making sure to deposit them in the bake-danuki's dwelling whenever she passed through.<br/>She did not explain herself, and in any case, did not consider this any sort of gift. If she had to describe it... then perhaps a sort of consolation to those who had turned from an unrighteous path might be the best description for such things.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Sara has been training with the Shogun's Army ever since she was taken in by the Tenryou Commission. The soldiers actually thought that she was a boy at first due to her coming to train at an early age, and they took care of her very well.<br/>Having been a little frightened of crowds at first, Sara became much more outgoing due to this warm reception, and would even play games with the other troops.<br/>However, the soldiers she played alongside were severely punished by the Clan Head, while she was merely given a cold chastening.<br/>\\\"Not following military law and neglecting your training... I did not take you in just to have you do such pointless things.\\\"<br/>Since then, Sara would be conscientious in maintaining a certain distance from others. Rather than blending in with the crowd, she sought first to attain surpassing martial prowess, bearing in mind at all times that she would someday take command.<br/>\\\"The Raiden Shogun's helper. An example to the Tenryou Commission. The pride of the Clan Head.\\\"<br/>None of these three identities put her first in any way. But to Sara, this was her. She was a warrior whose being was calm and austerity.<br/>No one ever told her that she should give herself more consideration, and Sara did not necessarily lack such concerns either.<br/>Her chains as an adopted child and the solitude of a non-human had always accompanied her mission and status.<br/>But to stop due to such obstacles is the dilemma of the weak, and being Kujou Sara, her path would not end here. She would be the Electro Archon's staunchest adherent and the most clear-headed of her generals.\"},{\"title\":\"Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder\",\"desc\":\"Out of their worship and love for the Raiden Shogun, many merchants have created and sold artwork related to her.<br/>The most popular product among them is the \\\"Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder,\\\" a lacquerware doll made using the deity's image as its template.<br/>Sara rose early the day it went on the market, easily becoming first in the queue to purchase the statue. This became something of a hot topic for a while.<br/>Sara would make no retort concerning any such stories. From her perspective, she bought that item with pious respect in her heart.<br/>In all matters related to the Shogun, she had never once committed a perfunctory or negligent act. Indeed, she went forth personally to select and purchase a statue and even personally prepared a shrine within which it might be kept upon her return.<br/>She placed five such statues in specially-placed display cases, and would clean them whenever she returned home. If she could not be there, she would arrange for artisans to perform that maintenance instead...<br/>To someone like Sara who lacks friends and who is too busy to have much of a private life, the Raiden Shogun is not merely a deity, but also a form of repose.<br/>The Shogun is her will, her future, her strength... even the harbinger of her fate — the confluence of all that is noble. Sara's adherence is one born out of recognition and trust.<br/>The intricately-made Archon statue makes Sara feel like the Almighty Shogun is not far off in her Tenshukaku, but is a wisdom, an ideal, a strength of heart that supports her every step of the way.<br/>These moments of tranquility bring her indescribable enjoyment.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"When she obtained her Vision, she had not yet been given a name or surname.<br/>She originally lived in a quiet mountain forest that had, from a time unknown, become plagued by great evils that robbed it of its former peace.<br/>Though she had the strength of the tengu, she was still young and could not stand against the monsters alone, and was hurled from a cliff during the battle, her wings having been damaged prior.<br/>Plummeting from the heights, and unable to unfurl her injured wings, she seemed fated to fall to her death.<br/>\\\"No! It can't end like this! I... I always believed that I could protect this place forever with my strength...\\\"<br/>When day dawned the next day, some passers-by discovered an unconscious girl by the roadside. She looked a little worse for the wear but seemed otherwise unharmed, adding to the mystery of how she had ended up here.<br/>Astonished, the people brought her back to the city and reported the matter to the Tenryou Commission immediately.<br/>That was when the Kujou Clan Head, Kujou Takayuki, noticed that the glowing item in her hand was a Vision — a thing that many desired but few ever gained.<br/>Realizing that she this child had gained the attention of an Archon even at her young age, Takayuki believed that she was a destined child, sent to the Tenryou Commission by the heavens.<br/>Taking her in, he named her \\\"Sara,\\\" and would train her to become an all-around warrior, asking that she serve the Shogun and fight for Inazuma.<br/>Kujou Takayuki believed that in raising such an excellent general, the status and future of the Kujou Clan would become more secure. And indeed, all that he had hoped would steadily come to pass.<br/>Sara, armed with her Vision, would swiftly distinguish herself, rising through the ranks to become a general of the Tenryou Commission at a young age, just as many had hoped.<br/>Yet it was precisely because she possessed a Vision that Sara knew this better than anyone: her surviving that fall unscathed was due to the Archon looking upon her with favor in that instant.<br/>In but a single glance, she had been given the power that sustained her life. Everything she had, therefore, could be described as existing by the Almighty Shogun's grace.<br/>Fighting for the Shogun...<br/>Sara believed that this was neither her duty nor a result of her foster father's schemes, but was instead her truest calling.\"}]}\n",

You may forget my name, but this you must know: On my watch, Inazuma will always be defended, and the will of the Shogun will always be done. Deity or demon, if you make an enemy of me you will be struck down! Oh, ahem... Don't be so nervous. I have agreed to fight by your side, and I will honor that commitment. I may be uncompromising on matters of great importance, but on most other things, you will find me quite easygoing.\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Target\",\"desc\":\"To strike your foe takes unity between mind, arrow, and bow.\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Eternity\",\"desc\":\"To manifest Eternity per the Almighty Shogun's will — that is what I aspire to.\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Duty\",\"desc\":\"The duty of a tengu warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the Kujou Clan is to guard Inazuma. These two are of the same ilk.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Rains\",\"desc\":\"The sound of rain masks the enemy's footsteps. Stay alert.\"},{\"title\":\"When Thunder Strikes\",\"desc\":\"Listen. Thunder speaks the will of the Almighty Shogun.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Snows\",\"desc\":\"I would like to catch a snowflake, but once you have them in the palm of your hand, they melt away all the more quickly.\"},{\"title\":\"When the Sun Is Out\",\"desc\":\"The skies are clear and the sun is bright. Fine weather for a showdown.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Morning\",\"desc\":\"Good morning...? You mean you only just got out of bed? This is already quite late by my standards. I typically rise well before daybreak.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"I am not in the habit of resting at noon. But if you wish to do so, I will wait for you.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"Good evening. You know, in Hanamizaka, the sight of the Sakura by night is quite splendid. I never tire of it.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"Go and rest. I will stay here and keep watch.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara: Tenryou Commission\",\"desc\":\"I am grateful to Takayuki. The Tenryou Commission is all I've ever had to rely on, and I will do everything within my power to defend my family's honor. Hmm? You want to know about the Tenryou Commission's code of conduct? Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War\",\"desc\":\"Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara: Aspiration\",\"desc\":\"My aspirations? I thought you already knew: To assist the Almighty Shogun in manifesting Eternity. That is what I aspire to. Hmm? Personal aspirations? It's not something I have ever thought about before...\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Observation\",\"desc\":\"Though you present an unstable factor in the Almighty Shogun's Eternity, unstable does not have to mean a threat. So I am not your enemy — but I will be watching you at all times.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Experiences\",\"desc\":\"When I confiscated people's Visions, I trampled on their ambitions. Now that the Vision Hunt Decree has been repealed, I must atone for my actions. I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the Statue of the Omnipresent God? I'd like you to tell me more about them. Also... your own ambitions, I would like to hear about those as well.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"Only if the gods cast their gaze upon you will you receive a Vision. Since my own Vision was granted by the Almighty Shogun, I shall return it to her in the end, without hesitation and with no regrets.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Spinning Top\",\"desc\":\"During a previous assignment, a vendor in Hanamizaka gifted me a kind of spinning top called the \\\"Solo.\\\" It's a toy that you can play with when you're by yourself. I was quite taken with it, so I kept it. ...You want to play with it together? But that would defy the principle on which the Solo is based... Respectfully, I must decline.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Local Specialty\",\"desc\":\"Do you know what the most distinctively Inazuman item of all is? No, it is not a blade of any sort. It is a lacquerware carving of the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder. They are hand-made by old and skilled lacquerware craftspeople, and nearly every single home in the city has one. My house, you ask? I have five.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"Whenever something is bothering me inside, I stand beneath the Sacred Sakura, close my eyes, and try to calm my mind. When I open my eyes again, the falling blossoms will guide my path.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma\",\"desc\":\"The Tenryou Commission's estate is very large. It would serve us well to have a fine housekeeper like Thoma who could keep all the numerous and disparate household affairs in order. If he ever tires of working for the Kamisato Clan, I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka\",\"desc\":\"In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya\",\"desc\":\"As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shikanoin Heizou\",\"desc\":\"Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results... <br/>*sigh* He is such a headache.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun: Trust\",\"desc\":\"As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity — an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. \\\"Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity\\\"... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun: Service\",\"desc\":\"So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko\",\"desc\":\"Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sangonomiya Kokomi\",\"desc\":\"She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not.\"},{\"title\":\"About Gorou\",\"desc\":\"Gorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better.\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto\",\"desc\":\"Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kuki Shinobu\",\"desc\":\"With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kujou Sara: I\",\"desc\":\"You want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kujou Sara: II\",\"desc\":\"I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kujou Sara: III\",\"desc\":\"The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kujou Sara: IV\",\"desc\":\"Although I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...<br/>I'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kujou Sara: V\",\"desc\":\"Now that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides — diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that.\"},{\"title\":\"Kujou Sara's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"To this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me — it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline.\"},{\"title\":\"Kujou Sara's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"The existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say \\\"come closer,\\\" I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Excellent timing. I will dispense with the formalities and get straight to the point — do you have a birthday wish? Providing that it does not conflict with the Almighty Shogun's grand cause, I will make every effort to see it come to fruition. To show that I am being completely serious, I will allow you to make not one, but five birthday wishes.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"My bow sounds in peak condition. One shot is all I need.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Power duly assimilated. Ready to receive instruction.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"The Shogun's Army might as well just be me!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"The responsibility for honing my strength and advancing my martial abilities lies with me, and yet you have so diligently and willingly helped me... I will become worthy of this power by harnessing it for a higher cause! Also... the favor of the tengu will always be with you!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Quiver!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Strike!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Flash!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Glory to the Shogun!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"No turning back!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Storm the front!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Excellent.

Its director and soul — a famed opera singer named Yun Jin — takes the stage at the tea house from time to time.<br/>While one can always get delicious delicacies or good storytelling as long as one knows where to look, Yun Jin's performance does not just await one there.<br/>As a result, you can always find fans of Yun Jin trying their luck at Heyu Tea House. While waiting for Yun Jin's performance, they discuss her past performances and how they feel about them.<br/>As such, more people frequent the tea house, with nine out of ten of them being Yun Jin's fans.<br/>Fan Er'ye couldn't be more satisfied with this state of affairs.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Liyue Opera is one of the traditional arts of Liyue that has been passed down for generations.<br/>Liyue Opera enjoys a long history, and it has gone through quite some changes from what it was originally created to be.<br/>The good thing is, the Liyue Opera we see now retains the sophisticated-sounding vocals and richly varied melodies of old.<br/>Liyue Opera performers usually perform in troupes, and the most acclaimed one of them is the Yun-Han Opera Troupe.<br/>For generations, the troupe has been run by the historic house of Yun, and its current director is a prominent figure in Liyue Harbor — the opera singer Yun Jin.<br/>Yun Jin made her name at a young age when she stunned her audience with a sweet voice and lively costumes in her debut performance.<br/>The more she performs, the better-honed her animated and dynamic style becomes.<br/>Whether it's a delicate and dignified young lady or a mighty and honorable heroine, she can play any role.<br/>What's even rarer is that this young actress is also a playwright. Other than \\\"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\\\" the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has performed many other new plays in recent years, all of which were written by Yun Jin.<br/>With her superb skill, it is no wonder why long-time opera fans often visit Heyu Tea House to ask about Yun Jin's performance schedule when their starving ears demand good opera singing.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Yun Jin was born in a family of Liyue Opera performers.<br/>Her father is a playwright, and her mother used to be a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, taking up the mantle from Yun Jin's grandfather.<br/>In such an environment, Yun Jin was exposed to Liyue Opera at a very early age, often amusing herself by echoing her mother's singing.<br/>A childhood hobby, as many would tend to believe, seems unlikely to be developed into a lifelong career, yet Yun Jin proved to be an exception.<br/>She was serious about it and insisted on learning the art.<br/>Her parents were delighted to see their daughter's determination and imparted everything they knew about the Liyue Opera to her. As such, Yun Jin started learning the opera early.<br/>However, Liyue Opera is a complex art that takes years of perfection to master.<br/>So even for a child as gifted as Yun Jin, what awaited her was sweat and tears. While ordinary children might shy away from the pain of hamstring stretches and the tedium of memorizing lyrics, little Yun Jin hung tough and became quite accomplished.<br/>By the time she finished all the subjects in Liyue Opera, veterans of Yun-Han Opera Troupe who watched her grow up couldn't help but exclaim,<br/>\\\"Yet another rising opera star is about to shine upon Liyue Harbor!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Many veterans of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe first joined the troupe when Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge.<br/>They have remained committed since Yun Jin took the troupe over.<br/>Their love for the art of Liyue Opera is so deep — perhaps even to an excessive degree — that they frown upon any other forms of music performance, including rock 'n' roll.<br/>Yun Jin, however, thinks otherwise. She finds that rock 'n' roll vibrates with vigor and even became friends with the rock 'n' roll musician Xinyan.<br/>Elders of the troupe are glad to follow Yun Jin's lead during rehearsals, but when it comes to daily life, they treat her like their little granddaughter.<br/>\\\"Sweetie, listen to us. No spicy food, it hurts your voice. Meat is fine, but refrain from eating too much, or you will put on weight.\\\"<br/>\\\"If you really can't help yourself, have more shrimp. Stay away from the... roll 'n' roll thing. All they know is yelling.\\\"<br/>These caring elders will nag Yun Jin about attending rock 'n' roll performance for hours on end.<br/>Faced with the impossible mission of persuading stubborn granddads and grannies, Yun Jin has to be creative.<br/>While it's not an option to go to Xinyan's performance, it's perfectly acceptable to visit Fan Er'ye's adopted daughter Xingyan and discuss Liyue Opera with her.<br/>The elders are not fond of the rock star Xinyan, but they have taken a shine to Xingyan the adopted daughter of Fan Er'ye.<br/>\\\"I've heard that Xingyan can cook and do embroidery. She must be a polite and accomplished young lady. Yun Jin may be able to pick up a thing or two from hanging out with her. How capital!\\\"<br/>Yun Jin has long got Fan Er'ye to agree on the details concerning the made-up Xingyan, so don't worry. No one's gonna call her out on this!\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Yun Jin goes by many names. To some, she is Director Yun, and to others, Sir Yun.<br/>They call her Director Yun for her leadership of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. Though there are managers to help with everyday work, Yun Jin is the one who makes the big decisions. She thus earned the name of Director Yun from people in business circles.<br/>As for Sir Yun, that is another story.<br/>When Yun Jin's grandfather was in charge of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe, long-time fans respectfully addressed him as Sir Yun. After Yun Jin took charge later, these fans frequented her performances as well.<br/>There was once after a show when an impressed fan half-joked with others, \\\"the Sir Yun we have now sings rather well too.\\\"<br/>A voice from the crowd immediately countered by saying: \\\"How can you address a young girl as Sir?\\\"<br/>Upon hearing this, Yun Jin curved her lips.<br/>\\\"Those who were born early, learn early. They are naturally better-informed than others. It's every bit right for them to be referred to as Sirs.\\\"<br/>\\\"But one doesn't have to be old to be knowledgeable. Besides, why can't a girl be knowledgeable?\\\"<br/>\\\"You are quick in mind and speech, and are thus qualified to be called Sir. I have answered your eminent question — that also makes me a Sir.\\\"<br/>Her remarks impressed the fans present, who shared this story to many. In the end, everyone followed the trend and started to call her Sir Yun whether they had or had not met her in person.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Many traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.<br/>A prime example would be \\\"The Divine Damsel of Devastation.\\\" People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.<br/>When Yun Jin was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.<br/>Why not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?<br/>Stories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.<br/>Maybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.<br/>In love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.<br/>Yun Jin is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions.<br/>\\\"So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls.\\\"<br/>This is the unspoken wish that Yun Jin has so far only kept to herself.\"},{\"title\":\"Longevity Lock\",\"desc\":\"Her ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.<br/>Later, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to Yun Jin's generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.<br/>Many forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that Yun Jin carries with her is one such item.<br/>In her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.<br/>Her parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.<br/>So instead of stopping her, they gave Yun Jin the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.<br/>Since then, the lock has never left Yun Jin's side. Before every performance, it is a routine for Yun Jin to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.<br/>It feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little Yun Jin who was learning the opera.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Shortly after Yun Jin's debut, Yun Jin quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.<br/>At the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.<br/>In every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.<br/>As time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.<br/>The music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in \\\"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\\\" seemed no different from the fisherman's daughter in \\\"String of Pearls.\\\"<br/>While the audience did not object, Yun Jin was not satisfied. \\\"Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?\\\"<br/>What broke her bottleneck was an opera named \\\"Snow Treading.\\\"<br/>It was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when Yun Jin first performed the opera.<br/>Having gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. Yun Jin, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.<br/>That was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.<br/>To breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.<br/>That was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.<br/>Yun Jin could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve.\"}]}\n",

Oh? ...You're not tired?\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"Let's go listen to tonight's storytelling performance together. Liu Su's rendition of \\\"Ring of Raining Blades\\\" is most sublime!\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"There's a chill in the air tonight, so you mustn't stay out late. Good night!\"},{\"title\":\"About Yun Jin: Schooling\",\"desc\":\"My schooling started very early. In fact, my earliest memories are of my father teaching me to read. Despite my best efforts, my ability is not half of his. Enough to write operas, but compared to his level of erudition, I still have much to strive for.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yun Jin: Opera Training\",\"desc\":\"In her youth, my mother was a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, and I learned all the operas I know from her. But, you could never imagine how strict she was with me as a teacher. Thinking back on it now, I... *sigh* No, no, no, I'd rather not think about it at all.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Opera Troupe\",\"desc\":\"We have some grand performances coming up soon, and it just so happens that we have an opening for someone to play the part of a skilled swordfighter. I think you'd be a perfect match for the part. How about it? Would you like to join our troupe? We can even enjoy some tea together in between acts.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Rock 'n' Roll\",\"desc\":\"Huh? You like rock 'n' roll? Oh, that's great! I'll be sure to bring you along the next time I go out to see a show. And when I get back, I can just tell the senior troupe members that I went out to visit you... Hehe, that way, they won't have any reason to get on my case about going out.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"Hmm? My Vision? Hehe, I suppose the Lord of Geo must be a fan of the opera. Perhaps the old man was so delighted with my performance that he decided to grant me a Vision.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Drinks\",\"desc\":\"One of my absolute favorite pastimes is trying out all kinds of new beverages. I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with — you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Dreams\",\"desc\":\"Sometimes, I just feel like casting off my opera costume and going traveling overseas. You know, to explore the outside world. For now, I'll need to keep working hard at what I'm doing, so someday that dream can come true.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"The chirping of the songbirds at daybreak always puts me in the best of moods.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xinyan\",\"desc\":\"The elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. \\\"It's for your own good,\\\" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that.\"},{\"title\":\"About Hu Tao\",\"desc\":\"Ah yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too — you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around.\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli\",\"desc\":\"The customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"The Tianquan is a big spender and has made several very generous donations to our troupe. I can only return her generosity by delivering my best possible performance.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xingqiu\",\"desc\":\"Oh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shenhe\",\"desc\":\"I have long since known \\\"The Divine Damsel of Devastation\\\" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the \\\"divine damsel\\\" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again.\"},{\"title\":\"About Keqing\",\"desc\":\"I have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"Kaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yun Jin: I\",\"desc\":\"Many of the operas we've been performing recently are new ones that I wrote after assuming the directorship of the troupe. I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yun Jin: II\",\"desc\":\"Per the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yun Jin: III\",\"desc\":\"At the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yun Jin: IV\",\"desc\":\"Now that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yun Jin: V\",\"desc\":\"Well you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be \\\"The Divine Damsel of Devastation,\\\" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you.\"},{\"title\":\"Yun Jin's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My hobbies? Well, opera, of course! It's what I truly love and it's what I will be pursuing for the rest of my life.\"},{\"title\":\"Yun Jin's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"*sigh* Well, as you can probably imagine, I always have to be mindful of what I eat and make sure I stay in shape. It's a shame, because the temptation to indulge in all the tasty delicacies the city has to offer is just as strong to me as to anyone else...\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Tianshu Meat, Black-Back Perch Stew, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot... Oh, I just want them all! Unfortunately, I basically never get to eat such things, but... um, if you don't mind me asking... Can you cook any of those dishes?\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Every day's the same... Stir-Fried Shrimp, day in and day out. No matter how they prepare it, it always tastes the same. Ugh, ghastly! I really can't stand it anymore...\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Oh, so today's your birthday? Well, I wouldn't know how to throw you a feast if I tried... so how about I sing you a song? For you alone, an audience of one. So... what song would you like to hear me sing? The choice is yours.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"As the saying goes: \\\"Achievement in a field is the result of how hard you are willing to work at it, not how much you enjoy it.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"It looks like all my rigorous training is finally paying off.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"I began my training in the art of the spear hoping to enhance my performance in stage combat. I stuck with it hoping to master the techniques of self-defense. Today, it looks like I have finally achieved both of these goals.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"The art of the spear is a vast and profound discipline... There is an almost infinite number of things one can learn. I am glad to have had you by my side during my training. Haha, I believe I've grasped the basics now. I daresay you'd better be careful when we're sparring together in the future.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"And step!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"And leap!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Flags up!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: IV\",\"desc\":\"Flags fly!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: V\",\"desc\":\"Observe!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Break a leg!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Strike as one!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Your grand finale!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"The troupe appreciates any donation.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... Anything the troupe could use on our journey?\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"No need to stand on ceremony. I'll just take this.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"Oof, watch the costume!\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"Ugh, the curtain's not down yet...\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"This script needs a rewrite...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"Thank you...

Countless choices lay before them, but the mountain was silent.<br/>Leaderless and without any supplies, the unit was on its last legs. With their morale flagging, thoughts of surrender shrouded many minds.<br/>At this critical moment, Gorou stood up. He rejected negotiation and surrender, and instead proposed a bold plan.<br/>They would not hide any longer. Instead, he would lead the larger part of the platoon in a feigned attack to buy the others a chance to call for reinforcements. Once those reinforcements arrived, they could perform a pincer attack together.<br/>When asked what they should do if they failed, Gorou replied:<br/>\\\"If the enemy surrounds us any further, our options will be even more limited. The way I see it, we still have a chance, so we've got to give it all we've got.\\\"<br/>\\\"I'll take responsibility if the plan fails.\\\"<br/>After holding the line for several days without rest, the exhausted Gorou and his companions were finally relieved by a force led by Sangonomiya Kokomi herself.<br/>After that, he was promoted to serve as the captain of Gorgasia II, and from there he would work his way up to the rank of General.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"In the eyes of the men, Gorou is a strict but humble general.<br/>He is straightforward and easy-going, and he treats his subordinates like his own family, sharing weal and woe with them.<br/>Sangonomiya Kokomi once told Gorou that materiel, supplies, and salaries were the three most important things to an army.<br/>From that day on, he would personally explain weapon maintenance to his subordinates. Every time the granaries were opened, he would supervise the process strictly to prevent any unlawful deductions.<br/>And as General Gorou, he will always lead from the front.<br/>The sight of him charging at the tip of the spear is like a rallying banner, encouraging the troops behind him to continue advancing.<br/>These are all reasons why the troops greatly respect him. As with Kokomi, Gorou greatly treasures the lives of his troops, but by contrast, values his own quite little.<br/>Some who understand little of the thought process behind this occasionally joke that Gorou is a \\\"kid\\\" who doesn't seem like a general at all.<br/>But to the soldiers of Watatsumi Island, this kid is the best general they could ask for.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Gorou is valiant and decisive, often leading inferior forces to victory over superior opposition.<br/>However, he does have a shortcoming of his own — a sometimes unstable temper.<br/>That is to say that the blood sometimes rushes to his head at the height of a battle.<br/>War is cruel, and Gorou does indeed lack experience compared to veterans who have been scrapping it out on battlefields for decades.<br/>Fortunately, he learns fast and is currently trying to make up for his various small failings.<br/>Sangonomiya Kokomi often provides her various commanders with directives, but how they are used is up to the skill of the commander in question.<br/>For his part, Gorou is always able to execute the courses of action that best suit the present situation from the directives he has been given.<br/>Gorou believes that over time, he will come to internalize the concepts behind them. Perhaps then, he can take the field with even more confidence than before.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"At Yae Miko's request, Gorou has taken up a certain extra \\\"job\\\" at Yae Publishing House.<br/>With the end of the Vision Hunt Decree, and the successful negotiations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, relations between the two sides are beginning to warm.<br/>Gorou has also visited Narukami Island quite a few times to check out the changes, buy a few popular books, and go to Yae Publishing House to complete the task he agreed to help with.<br/>Yae Miko set up an anonymous column for Gorou in the \\\"That's Life\\\" magazine. Here, readers will write about the things that trouble them and send them to Yae Publishing House, upon which Gorou will give them some suggestions.<br/>Yae Publishing House will take special care to redact any personal information revealed on the part of the write-ins or Gorou's replies, and will replace real names with pseudonyms.<br/>According to Yae Miko, she chose him because she'd heard that he often listened to his subordinates when they chatted about personal matters.<br/>The column proved to be very popular indeed, but for whatever reason, every time an editor delivers the royalties to Gorou, they might sheepishly ask:<br/>\\\"Ah, speaking of which, Gorou, have you heard of Ms. Hina?\\\"<br/>\\\"I've heard that she's a rather popular columnist, and a recent one, too. Is something the matter?\\\"<br/>\\\"Oh, no, no... It's nothing...\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Just as the troops don't exactly tell Gorou everything happening in their lives, Gorou, too, has some troubles that are difficult to share.<br/>For example, how his tail fur starts to get dull and look haggard after being exposed to the elements for too long, and how he'd love to tend to it — if he could only spare the time out in the field.<br/>Or how he sometimes feels a bit inferior about his slight physique when bathing together with his subordinates.<br/>Or about how encountering inscrutable women like Yae Miko sends him into defense mode instantly, rendering him unable to properly interact with them...<br/>In trying to maintain a respectable image, Gorou refrains from telling his soldiers about such troubles.<br/>And while they have been able to guess at his troubles to some extent, the Watatsumi soldiers often just play along and pretend that they don't notice.<br/>As such, his worries just kept piling up, until the Traveler arrived, thus granting the Watatsumi general, ever good at banishing the worries of others, someone who could help relieve him of his own woes.\"},{\"title\":\"Mountaineering Gear\",\"desc\":\"Of Gorou's various hobbies, \\\"mountaineering\\\" is likely up there in the top three.<br/>Sweating it out while climbing a mountain with companions before admiring the beauty all around you helps to train both the mind and body and is a great camaraderie-builder.<br/>To better enjoy this hobby of his, Gorou bought a set of mountaineering gear from a traveling merchant.<br/>The set is not particularly pricey, but it is both sturdy and durable and has seen Gorou through many dangerous ascents.<br/>Just as he maintains his weapons well, Gorou has also kept this set of gear in tip-top shape. There is little doubt that it will accompany him through many future journeys as well.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"There was a time when Gorou ascribed responsibility for victory or loss in battle entirely to himself.<br/>\\\"If only I became a little stronger, perhaps I'd be able to turn the tide.\\\"<br/>It was in this spirit that Gorou trained his archery day and night, hoping to rely on his strength to lead his comrades to victory.<br/>But after some time on the battlefield, Gorou saw powerful warriors being isolated and captured alive, while weak troops in inferior positions could rout their enemies through unity.<br/>That was when Gorou realized that a single person's battlefield capabilities are limited.<br/>Getting stronger is important, naturally, but uniting the troops to fight as one is even more crucial.<br/>A troop can only be unbeatable if they are strong together.<br/>Having realized this, Gorou no longer pursued the apex of excellence in archery, but instead invested time and effort in those around him, helping everyone improve together.<br/>Thinking back on it, this may have opened the door for Gorou to obtain his Vision.\"}]}\n",

It allows me to take greater responsibility on the battlefield and forge a way forward for the troops. But I also understand that one person alone, no matter how strong, is never enough to turn the tide of a battle. The key to victory is everyone's united effort, fighting for a common cause.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Dressed for Battle\",\"desc\":\"I don't like to enter battle wearing lots of heavy equipment. I travel light, that's my style. My strength is in moving quickly around the battlefield, seeking out opportunities to take control of the fight. I always target the strongest warriors first to weaken the enemy's morale.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Ever-Victorious General\",\"desc\":\"The troops have come up with a nickname for me, the \\\"ever-victorious pointy-eared general.\\\" Now there's even a rumor going around saying that \\\"if you want Top Dog Gorou's victorious luck, give his pointy ears a rub.\\\" Grrr, there will be no rubbing of my ears, and that's final. If they think they can smile their way into persuading me otherwise, well, they've got another thing... Hmm? Hey, wh—what are you doing? Not you too...? Come on now, I... I thought I... Mm.... Mm...\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"I've heard that there's a mountain range in Liyue that reaches all the way up into the clouds. Ah, I'd relish a chance to go climbing there!\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"I've seen all kinds of wandering samurai before, and Kazuha is categorically a different breed from the others. He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!\"},{\"title\":\"About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Duties\",\"desc\":\"As the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan. It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Attitude\",\"desc\":\"I have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun\",\"desc\":\"Grr, the Raiden Shogun... I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"I have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko\",\"desc\":\"Oh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her...\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka\",\"desc\":\"The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sayu\",\"desc\":\"Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shikanoin Heizou\",\"desc\":\"You mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Gorou: I\",\"desc\":\"Hmm, I'm afraid that most of my days have been spent on the battlefield, so there's not much to tell about me. But if you'd really like to hear my stories, I'm happy to sit down and tell you everything!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Gorou: II\",\"desc\":\"I may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Gorou: III\",\"desc\":\"At first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Gorou: IV\",\"desc\":\"Her Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Gorou: V\",\"desc\":\"We are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.\"},{\"title\":\"Gorou's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"I love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma...\"},{\"title\":\"Gorou's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"There are times when being lightly armored has its shortcomings... For example, I have to be particularly careful of my tail when the enemy attacks with fire.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"My favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception. One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing. The soldiers from logistics felt terrible about it, too.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Today's a momentous occasion, your birthday! Allow me to arrange all the celebrations for you! We can make a bonfire on the beach and catch some fresh fish and crabs. I'll personally prepare a morale-boosting meal that would make even the highest-ranking generals jealous.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"With this newfound strength, I will defend those who fight alongside me.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Protecting my soldiers doesn't just mean having a robust defense in place. Sometimes, it means going on the attack!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"The key to seizing victory in battle lies in remembering the meaning of battle and employing the right tactics to generate momentum, making your forces unstoppable.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"With momentum on our side and close camaraderie, we are unstoppable. Thank you for your guidance. This is a victory that belongs to the both of us.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Advance!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Charge!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Fall in!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Everyone on me!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Press the advantage!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Rally!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"The tide of battle is in our favor!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Let's distribute these among our forces.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"Careful, it could be a trap... Oh? Nevermind.\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"Follow my lead!\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"I can still fight!\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"I got careless!\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"Surrender is not an option!\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"We're... defeated...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: II\",\"desc\":\"For...

Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.<br/>On the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and Eula.<br/>For Eula is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.<br/>Consequently, Eula has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.<br/>So, whenever Eula appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.<br/>However, Eula is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.<br/>When people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \\\"vengeance.\\\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.<br/>One person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of Eula.<br/>\\\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"On the one hand, she is a descendant of the disgraced Lawrence Clan, the scion of a corrupt aristocracy. On the other, she is one of the top two sword fighters in Mondstadt.<br/>In other words, Eula is equal parts tainted blood and superior swordsmanship.<br/>There is no knowing when she might strike, nor what she might take from you... In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.<br/>Eula responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \\\"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\\\"<br/>She is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.<br/>On one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched just such a scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while Eula made a beeline for Master Jean's office.<br/>Much to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.<br/>Still worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.<br/>\\\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was she marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to settle a score?\\\"<br/>\\\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\\\"<br/>Lisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:<br/>\\\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\\\"<br/>\\\"Ohh... S—So that's how it is...\\\" \\\"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\\\"<br/>This kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"In truth, Eula is nothing like the fearsome predator many imagine her to be. On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.<br/>At one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, Eula's work is fraught with difficulties.<br/>When conflict arises, Eula fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.<br/>Funnily enough, although people always have their guard up around Eula, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.<br/>No one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.<br/>Eula, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... Eula, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.<br/>When Jean sends a new recruit to track down Eula in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: \\\"If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought.\\\"<br/>But despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.<br/>Everyone knows Eula as the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, an openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?<br/>On the way back, the new recruit thinks back over Eula's every action.<br/>\\\"What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn't looking at me? She seems to take her work seriously... So, surely she can be relied on after all?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Mondstadt is a city of freedom and happiness where even the descendants of a disgraced former ruling class can find true friends.<br/>Fortunately, there is one person whom Eula can rely on to be her spokesperson to the Mondstadt masses, and that person is Outrider Amber.<br/>Everybody loves Amber, so when she is around, shopkeepers will sell their wares to Eula at the normal price. If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that Eula shows her most agreeable side.<br/>Because of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany Eula on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.<br/>Amber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of Eula's long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.<br/>Early one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing Eula's latest highlights: \\\"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port. The woman in question was a renowned legal expert from Liyue, and the Knights of Favonius have since received official correspondence from the Liyue Communications Office thanking the Reconnaissance Captain for her deeds...\\\"<br/>Whether because Amber's persistent efforts have overcome historical prejudices or because Eula's achievements as a knight have quelled the long-standing fear in people's hearts, Eula's life has changed noticeably in recent years. Most of the city folk are no longer openly hostile towards her, and she has won over the members of the Knights of Favonius with her consistent results in the field.<br/>As for the members of the Reconnaissance Company under her leadership, they support her unconditionally. They always have her back when they head out to Mondstadt's outskirts to defend the peace of their nation.<br/>Of course, the person who has always tirelessly rooted for Eula, and who is now the most delighted to see people's attitudes towards her change, is Amber. They had been friends for a long time before Eula ever joined the Knights of Favonius, and as the beloved mentee of Amber's grandfather, the first Outrider, Eula has her complete trust.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"One might not expect this from her frosty attitude and sharp tongue, but Eula is a talented chef.<br/>The Reconnaissance Company today prides itself on having the best field rations in the Knights of Favonius. One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.<br/>The Reconnaissance Company's designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain's own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.<br/>Even after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can't help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain's original recipe taste?<br/>The answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.<br/>\\\"Noble obligations\\\" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.<br/>In the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, \\\"Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity.\\\"<br/>The Lawrence Clan's culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as Eula is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.<br/>For this reason, the only kind of person who Eula will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts \\\"will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Besides traditional etiquette, art is the second most highly prized asset to the aristocrats, known as the \\\"second soul.\\\"<br/>The \\\"Dance of Sacrifice\\\" — a ritual used by illustrious families to display their nobility — is thought of as the crystallized form of this soul, the prize gem in the ruler's scepter.<br/>Folklore holds that Mondstadt's most illustrious clans jointly created the Dance of Sacrifice long before the aristocracy's reign of bloodshed began.<br/>The third act, which represents the Lawrence Clan, is a solo dance known as \\\"Flickering Candlelight.\\\" The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.<br/>The Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.<br/>This ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.<br/>However, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer's posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.<br/>Over time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.<br/>As the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, Eula found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.<br/>Today, Eula appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.<br/>Nevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in Eula's bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.<br/>As her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.\"},{\"title\":\"Glaciers and Waves\",\"desc\":\"Eula is the bearer of the Lawrence family crest, the \\\"Glacial Seal.\\\" It is the highest martial symbol of the clan and represents the spirit of the Lawrence Clan in the early days of Mondstadt before their fall from grace: cold and unsullied, undaunted by any flame, composed and unshaken in all circumstances.<br/>Few among their number have passed the clan's trials in a thousand years, and the hopes of the clan are passed down from one seal-bearer to the next.<br/>Eula was still quite young when she underwent the trial but she passed with ease, taking up the seal in the process. Then she departed with that badge of honor in her possession and has barely contacted the clan since.<br/>Her icy sword is a manifestation of the strength represented by the seal, striking with the cold, brutal force of a relentless blizzard and driving her foes into retreat.<br/>Yet, sharp and bright as ice as she is, she has the title of \\\"Spindrift Knight,\\\" a name that leads many who hear it to assume that she manipulates Hydro instead of Cryo.<br/>There is a story behind that misunderstanding — the story of a habit.<br/>Eula carries an exquisitely crafted bone whistle with her at all times. Each time she blows it, the vivid sound of ocean waves rings out loud and clear, far and wide.<br/>Since the area her company is in charge of borders the sea, reproducing the sound of waves can be an excellent means of disturbing the enemy's judgment, or of deceiving less intelligent monsters into believing that a tsunami is inbound, causing them to flee in panic.<br/>Using this unique combat tactic has helped Eula emerge victorious against larger forces than her own on numerous occasions, and has also earned her the moniker of \\\"Spindrift Knight.\\\"<br/>Of course, a bone whistle is capable of imitating many other sounds, and Eula has her reasons for imitating the ocean waves.<br/>It would seem that something akin to the \\\"Glacier Knight\\\" should suit her better.<br/>But perhaps Eula herself prefers the rolling waves to the cold and unyielding ice...<br/>Roaming freely across the world, gentle but firm with the reefs and sands in their dominion...<br/>Yes, she yearns not to be sharp and rigid like ice, but to be free and unbound like the ocean spray.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Where do \\\"grievances\\\" come from?<br/>Dire straits in the present? Or the misfortunes of the past?<br/>And what does \\\"vengeance\\\" mean?<br/>To right wrongs and rebalance the scales of justice in one's favor? Or to drive one's foes into a pit of agony?<br/>\\\"Restore the clan's former glory, win the respect of the common folk, stand once more at the apex of rulership\\\"... These things were utterly unimportant to Eula.<br/>She had never experienced the great humiliation of her clan — and all the torment she had endured in life had been at their own hands. She attempted to free herself from their shackles, yet struggled to obtain recognition from the outside world.<br/>Her talk of grievances and vengeance was but a habit, a signal, a shield.<br/>For someone in her unique circumstances and position, what remarks should she just laugh off, and what ideas should she hold onto?<br/>How should she fight this battle to break free, once and for all, from the great burden of her bloodline?<br/>It was with all these questions and more circling around in her mind that Eula came under the tutelage of a long-forgotten old outrider. From him, she learned an open-mindedness and down-to-earth persistence that she had never previously encountered.<br/>Before grappling with grievances and vengeance, before questions of clan and outsider, she first had to discover herself.<br/>Her survival mechanism... her means of self-preservation... her grit and determination...<br/>She may articulate it in terms of \\\"grievances\\\" and \\\"vengeance,\\\" but nothing can change what it is at its core: something both strong and kind.<br/>Eula finally found herself on a gentle path of revenge that was hers alone... and the moment she set foot on that path, there it appeared before her — her Vision.\"}]}\n",

Heh, alright then, I'll teach you.... Oh yes, I'll teach you, alright, mark my words...\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Rules\",\"desc\":\"Aristocratic etiquette is all just for show... Just smile and nod along! I was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even I don't take them that seriously.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Rains\",\"desc\":\"Quick, under the umbrella, or you'll get soaked! You can't risk catching a cold, because it might turn into something more serious, and if that happens... Well, I can't go avenging my clan by picking on the sick now, can I?\"},{\"title\":\"When Thunder Strikes\",\"desc\":\"This weather is a hindrance. The thunder drowns out all other sounds, hampering my perception of the surrounding environment.\"},{\"title\":\"When the Sun Is Out\",\"desc\":\"Visibility is excellent! If we head to higher ground, we can do a full recon of enemy activity in the area.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Morning\",\"desc\":\"Rise and shine! The two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. If you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"\\\"May the gentle breeze softly send thee into a sweet sleep.\\\" ...One of a select few aristocratic pleasantries that's actually quite lovely.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"Would you like to hear a lullaby on the bone whistle?

When it comes to my revenge, far more imaginative means of retribution are in order...\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula: The Knights\",\"desc\":\"The easiest way to destroy your enemy is to take them down from the inside, right? That's why I joined the Knights of Favonius.\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula: Bearing\",\"desc\":\"Since I'm a genuine Knight of Favonius, I fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. Look, I may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but I'm not a total degenerate!\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula: Scout\",\"desc\":\"The role of a scout is to hunt down enemy troops, or fend off the enemy in side skirmishes away from the main battle. There aren't a whole lot of rules, which suits my style very well indeed!\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula: Dance\",\"desc\":\"Not all customs of the Lawrence Clan are despicable. At least the \\\"Dance of Sacrifice\\\" is pure and noble. It puts my mind at ease and gives me comfort. It's been years, but it's still dear to me. My body remembers every step that I... Well anyway, to end this digression, those who wish to master my signature \\\"Favonius Bladework\\\" technique have to pass my dance class first.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Commonality\",\"desc\":\"We're not so different, you and I.

It could be in ten years, could even be twenty... But don't worry, I won't forget. In the meantime, I'll need you to take good care of yourself and have a happy, healthy life, okay?\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Descendant of a depraved dynasty\\\" isn't the most flattering reputation to have. The only way I can shake it for good is if I keep avenging my kin in my own way. Those who desire vengeance need power first, so it makes sense that I would get a Vision.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Bone Whistle\",\"desc\":\"My bone whistle makes a versatile range of sounds, which comes in handy for confusing the enemy. I often use it to imitate the sound of the sea, which is where I get my title of \\\"Spindrift Knight\\\" — this despite the fact that the bone whistle is actually a Liyue tradition.... But then again, no one seems to look too closely into that kind of thing. I'm mean, they took me on, and I'm an exile of Mondstadt trained by an outcast of Liyue...\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Wine-Tasting\",\"desc\":\"Technically, aged Dandelion Wine should be poured into a silver goblet and allowed to breathe for 12 minutes, then you're supposed to add ice cubes, ideally so 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine. I refuse to do all that though, it's not worth the hassle.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"Why do Mist Flowers have to be so rare? The powder they produce works wonders for the bone whistle. It gives it a crisper, clearer sound.\"},{\"title\":\"About Amber\",\"desc\":\"Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!\"},{\"title\":\"About Jean\",\"desc\":\"The Acting Grand Master's family and mine are sworn enemies. But she draws a clear line between professional and personal matters. She saw I was capable, admitted me into the Knights, and gave me lots of opportunities. So, when the time comes for vengeance, I'll afford her a reasonably soft landing.\"},{\"title\":\"About Lisa\",\"desc\":\"She's so annoying. She must have read thousands of books... could even be tens of thousands. Meaning, she can effortlessly recall any number of vile tales about the Lawrence Clan's corruption off the top of her head, accurate down to the exact date. Logically speaking, she'd be the perfect person to talk to about someone I'd like to track down, but... swallowing my pride would be too great a challenge.\"},{\"title\":\"About Barbara\",\"desc\":\"Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not.

He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity! I will not let it go!\"},{\"title\":\"About Venti\",\"desc\":\"I heard that bard sing a few songs about the Lawrence Clan... They were lighthearted and funny stories that mocked the clan in a way I've never heard anyone else do. Even I couldn't help but burst out laughing... And for this, he must pay!\"},{\"title\":\"About Razor\",\"desc\":\"Free from social mores and other people's opinions, and no family obligations... Must be an easy life!\"},{\"title\":\"About Sucrose\",\"desc\":\"The alchemist... She once gave me a piece of equipment and told me it would help me infiltrate an Abyss Order camp undetected. In reality, it caused a huge explosion that completely blew my cover and before I knew it I was being accosted by 13 mitachurls... Afterwards, I marched straight back there, intending to make her pay for what she had done, but when I saw how panicked and sheepish she looked, and watched her post her results on the wall with the word \\\"Fail,\\\" I couldn't bring myself to go through with it... After all, I didn't get hurt, just a little disheveled... and a little humiliated.\"},{\"title\":\"About Diluc\",\"desc\":\"I don't get along with some of the knights, and he doesn't think much of them in general, so you'd think that would make us allies. But the way he always acts so aloof — he's even worse than Acting Grand Master Jean. I want nothing to do with him.\"},{\"title\":\"About Diona\",\"desc\":\"Diona? She's a miracle worker when it comes to making cocktails, and to my surprise, we get along really well. She infiltrated a tavern with the hopes of tearing down the wine industry, while I infiltrated the knights to exact my revenge on them. A kindred spirit it seems...\"},{\"title\":\"About Yanfei: Encounter\",\"desc\":\"This one's a long story... We ended up saving her life once when we were tracking down a batch of dangerous cargo that belonged to the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo — and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yanfei: Assessment\",\"desc\":\"We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book... Also, with her smarts, maybe she could help me track someone down that I've been looking for... She does owe me a favor from last time, after all.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Eula: I\",\"desc\":\"The life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Eula: II\",\"desc\":\"People tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Eula: III\",\"desc\":\"The Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Eula: IV\",\"desc\":\"The name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Eula: V\",\"desc\":\"If my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!\"},{\"title\":\"Eula's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"I'm into all sorts of cool things. Sipping a nice cold drink, sitting in a canyon feeling the biting wind howl past my face, or diving into the lake at the foot of Dragonspine... Waiting for you to stroll by unsuspectingly, so I can sneak up behind you and drag you down into the icy depths...\"},{\"title\":\"Eula's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"Sometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers. But once they find out that I'm a Lawrence, suddenly everyone gets indignant and provocative, and starts trying to bait me out in some way. I just want to have a drink, is that too much to ask!?\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Today is a day worth observing, though you shouldn't mark your development in age alone. Accept my gift of a bone whistle, and allow me to teach you its secrets. When your day of reckoning comes, see how long you can fend me off with it... It'll make the whole thing much more exciting.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"My fighting skills just got a whole lot stronger... But I shouldn't get too conceited just yet. There are some truly formidable knights among our ranks, and I must outperform them immeasurably if I wish to defeat them and avenge my clan!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Good! With this much power, I daresay even the Acting Grand Master herself would be no match for me!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"How strange... In the time I've spent with you, my strength seems to have improved exceptionally quickly. I suppose I was rather fortunate to make an enemy of you. I'd better dig my teeth in to make sure you can't get away!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"Excellent! The unstoppable power of an immovable glacier dwells within me now and no grand master, acting or otherwise, can stand in my way! There is no time to delay. I must devise my plan, and unleash my attack! Once I have crushed the Knights of Favonius beneath my heel, my next target... is you. Don't try to run. Stand beside me and witness all that must come to pass.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Beg for mercy.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Shudder!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Crush!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: IV\",\"desc\":\"I condemn you!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: V\",\"desc\":\"Rack and ruin!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: VI\",\"desc\":\"Eye for an eye!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Flood of frost!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Freeze to the core!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Vengeance will be mine!\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"More speed.\"},{\"title\":\"Deploying Wind Glider: I\",\"desc\":\"Time to scout!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"What do we have here...\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"I can put these to good use.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"Ha, at least good luck doesn't discriminate by clan.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"The odds are against us...\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"Let us cross swords...\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"Well met!\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"What a sorry sight...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: II\",\"desc\":\"I'll be back... with a vengeance...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: III\",\"desc\":\"Guess I got my comeuppance...\"},{\"title\":\"Heavy Hit Taken: I\",\"desc\":\"Touché!\"},{\"title\":\"Heavy Hit Taken: II\",\"desc\":\"Good grief...\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: I\",\"desc\":\"Ready for reconnaissance.\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: II\",\"desc\":\"I'll scout ahead.\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: III\",\"desc\":\"What's your battle plan?\"}]}\n",

Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?\\\"<br/>Faced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, \\\"not free enough.\\\"<br/>Things like \\\"top sellers,\\\" \\\"genre fiction,\\\" these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.<br/>Getting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?<br/>\\\"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well.\\\"<br/>Upon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.<br/>The latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.<br/>\\\"Um... What do we do? This isn't good...\\\"<br/>\\\"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!\\\"<br/>\\\"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this.\\\"<br/>\\\"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae.\\\"<br/>Not long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name \\\"Kadenokouji Kenzaburou.\\\"<br/>As to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a \\\"Reborn as Guuji Yae\\\" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"If there was something inconvenient about being the Guuji, it is that she must attend every shrine ceremony, dressed up to the nines and in her proper place in the sanctuary.<br/>The fireworks paint the night skies as they blossom, and the sounds of human merriment fill the shrine, and yet she must sit within, a solemn smile on her face...<br/>Such tragedies are even more frightful to Miko than the possible wholesale disappearance of Fried Tofu from Teyvat.<br/>With the somewhat longer span of years that the Electro Archon's servants have, a hundred years pass in the blink of an eye. As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.<br/>And if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?<br/>As such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.<br/>And if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?<br/>On the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the Yashiro Commission — of Naganohara construction and specially-made to boot.<br/>That night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.<br/>The sight of the \\\"Lady Guuji\\\" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.<br/>In the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.<br/>And the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.<br/>\\\"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Pursuing fun and finding happiness is how Miko lives her everyday life.<br/>For someone who enjoys studying humanity like here, \\\"standpoints\\\" and \\\"virtue\\\" play distant second fiddles to \\\"fun.\\\"<br/>Even a great shrine maiden of a different faith or an enemy general might pique her interest.<br/>...That said, this appreciate can sometimes lead to some innocuous trouble.<br/>As opposed to those conscientious underlings or worshipful juniors, Miko's favorite person at the shrine is a shrine maiden named Kano Nana.<br/>Yes, that Kano Nana, the novel enthusiast (just like Miko) who constantly frets over Sayu.<br/>While laying about indoors, Miko would often see Sayu flash past the window, followed not long after by a hurried and angry Kano Nana.<br/>Like lightning and thunder they were, which caught Miko's attention, to the point where she would even sometimes give wrong directions just to let the ruckus go on for a little longer.<br/>There was another time when Sayu told Miko that the afternoon sun was the most pleasant after the latter had helped her steal some time for napping.<br/>Perhaps encouraged by these words, Miko would transform into an ordinary Inazuman lady on a wonderfully sunny afternoon, descend from the mountain and have a day out.<br/>The Aisa Bathhouse in the city, Hanamizaka's Kiminami Restaurant, Ogura Textiles and Kimonos by the streetside... she did not miss a single store, and every one was an enjoyable experience.<br/>And in the evening, she was at Bantan Sango Detective Agency to tell them of a missing animals case that she had heard about on the way.<br/>\\\"But you really must help, good detectives. I mean, one can barely stand to watch those owners cry their eyes out as it is...\\\"<br/>Having done all this, the lady could not help but let slip a pleased smile.<br/>Taking part in Inazuma's daily life in such an identity really was fun.<br/>Well, except that part where Kujou Sara shot her a suspicious glance as they passed each other by.<br/>Right, and also, she probably owed the boss of Aisa Bathhouse an apology — the outland-styled hot springs were indeed very good, but she might have accidentally shed some fox fur during the soak.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"A long, long time ago, humanity did not need to use the phrase \\\"a long, long time ago\\\" to preface tales about youkai.<br/>The tengu dominated the skies, the oni swept across the battlefield, the tanuki were seen along small paths, and the kitsune walked amongst humans.<br/>Under the banner of Narukami, the incredible powers of the youkai host were used to help humans through an era of strife and poverty.<br/>Seeking refuge in the mountains, they built a city by the sea, and so began Inazuma.<br/>Amongst the youkai, the lineage of Hakushin Kitsune was the most revered, and it was this great line that left a great many tales amongst humans.<br/>Whenever the youkai gathered to feast and sup together, a little braggadocio about how their latest exploits had become legend anew was very much a given.<br/>Of course, considering the amount they would drink, most tales told afterward would diverge a little from the truth. But no one minded, asking only that the tale be interesting. As time passed, this became known as \\\"hyakumonogatari daikai,\\\" or \\\"the great meeting of a hundred tales.\\\"<br/>It was no uncommon sight to see Urakusai raise his cup and speak, holding all the other youkai spellbound with his story, drawing even smiles from Kitsune Saiguu, the organizer of the event.<br/>Instead it was Miko, who was then in the form of a young kitsune, who would perch on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder and relentless peck at any loopholes in Urakusai's story.<br/>Urakusai, being a cool-headed and brilliant gentleman, would explain as he twirled his beard.<br/>But Miko could always find something new to nitpick, and so they would go, back and forth, until Lady Saiguu would smile and call both parties to a halt: the audience wanted to hear the next part, after all.<br/>After another three rounds of drink and several more rounds of stories, the company would be hard-pressed to even string a sentence together, let alone a story.<br/>And so the gathered youkai would dispense with the word-fencing and use their powers to take to the skies to see who could best cover the sky and moon with their powers.<br/>And thus it was said that \\\"a hundred youkai shall parade upon a moonless night.\\\"<br/>Five hundred years on, that little kitsune has already become a mighty youkai in her own right.<br/>As for the youkai who drank with them in those days, they disappeared amidst war and history, and their remaining bloodlines grow thinner by the day.<br/>And thus did their great parade, the Hyakkiyakou, become something that happened \\\"a long, long time ago.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The swords of Inazuma have always been famous the world over, and the best works of the Raiden Gokaden in particular are national treasures.<br/>However, only a short time ago, more than half of the five artisan lineages were cut off.<br/>A great number of powerful people were caught up in that conspiracy, and those responsible were all called to account and banished.<br/>Even the Yashiro Commision's Kamisato Clan became involved due to the incompetence of one of their subordinate supervisors.<br/>But before the Shogun could give her final judgment, the Lady Guuji, who usually did not meddle in government affairs, suddenly interceded, rescuing the Kamisato Clan in their hour of peril.<br/>Thus, while they suffered a serious blow, they were spared from dismissal.<br/>In the years that followed, others would speculate greatly concerning the Guuji's actions.<br/>Some observed the close relations between the Yashiro Commission and the Grand Narukami Shrine, and guessed that she had intended to foster advocates loyal to her.<br/>And yet the shrine had always been an entity unto itself, and the Lady Guuji did not usually meddle in governance. Thus this action seemed a sacrifice greater than the reward — hardly a wise decision.<br/>Some others said that the Guuji suspected something to be wrong with the whole situation, and now that the list of those involved was so extensive, any major shakeup in the Yashiro Commission could destabilize Inazuma itself.<br/>This thought, too, seemed reasonable on face, yet did not stand up to scrutiny. After all, was not the rise and fall of great houses merely ordinary in the grand scheme of mortal affairs? And even if the Kamisato were to fall from grace, new leadership for the Yashiro Commission would emerge.<br/>Yet another story said that Miko engaged in secret talks with the Kamisato clan head just after the initial shockwaves had died down.<br/>But the wounded clan was like a candle in the wind at this point. What power could they have to change the situation?<br/>To this day, all these speculations have never amounted to anything, nor have any answers emerged concerning Miko's actions and motivations.<br/>But what none know is how Miko's words that day would become as engraved into the Kamisato Clan as their house's crest.<br/>\\\"That the Kamisato Clan has survived this incident is only due to the Shogun's mercy. Do not forget this in the days that follow.\\\"<br/>These words would serve as a seed of destiny, foreshadowing the Yashiro Commission's future position.<br/>In some other time, if a storm were to descend upon Inazuma, and even if they were to come into conflict with the other two commissions, the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan would remember the favor they were shown and abide the Shogun's path to Eternity.<br/>This was a move that the Guuji played with no regrets whatsoever.\"},{\"title\":\"Fire-Soothing Festival Committee\",\"desc\":\"The Fire-Soothing Festival Committee was once an organization chaired by the Tenryou Commission and managed by the Grand Narukami Shrine, whose remit was to pray for a lack of any fires in the coming year.<br/>In those days, Inazuman houses were mostly made of wood, and any carelessness while handling fire could lead to disaster.<br/>Thus, the Tenryou Commission was charged by the Shogun with setting up fire brigades to conduct rescues and damage control when fires did break out, and they also requested that the Grand Narukami Shrine set the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee up to comfort the frightened people.<br/>In later years, anti-fire precautions would become second nature and serious cases would no longer occur often, but still the annual festival would remain.<br/>The shrine maidens would dance elegantly, and the people would give generously... with the proceeds split forty-sixty between the Commission and the Shrine.<br/>When Yae Miko was faced with financial issues while attempting to start Yae Publishing House, she considered the various services that the shrine ran at the time before locking onto this ancient traditional committee.<br/>\\\"I mean, the busywork is solely done by the Grand Narukami Shrine, so why do we have to split the proceeds with the Tenryou Commission?\\\"<br/>\\\"What's more, all that Mora's just going into Kujou Senior's pockets. It's not like the fire brigade has ever gotten a year-end bonus or anything.\\\"<br/>As such, after some preparation, the Fire-Soothing Festival of that year would be changed to no longer feature dancing shrine maidens but a grand, rollicking light novel submission contest.<br/>The organizing body for this competition and any subsequent publications, the \\\"Yae Publishing House,\\\" would also \\\"borrow\\\" the Fire-Soothing Festival Committee's budget.<br/>As for the profits? Into the shrine's coffers they went.<br/>\\\"Well, we no longer have many fires, and yet our budget keeps increasing. Thus, this restructuring relieves the financial burden placed upon the people.\\\"<br/>\\\"Also, the study of lore and the writing of literature and poetry is also a way of pleasing our Archon — surely you do not claim to know more of ritual and ceremony than I?\\\"<br/>That was what Yae Miko said most solemnly to Kujou Takayuki when he came by unannounced.<br/>The Tenryou Commissioner was ultimately forced to leave the way he came, stormy-faced, along with his attendants.<br/>Little did any of them know that the moment they stepped out of the shrine, the somber Lady Miko would pluck a novel manuscript from the nearby offering box and continue annotating it.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"\\\"That was a contest of magic for the ages! The foe split the seas as they strode across the skies, heaven and earth changing hue as they approached!\\\"<br/>\\\"Gohei in hand, the Lady Guuji was solemn as she strode up Mt. Yougou.\\\"<br/>\\\"All around her the shrine maidens chanted their mantras as the clouds masked the sun, the thunder waiting within for the moment to strike!\\\"<br/>\\\"...\\\"<br/>\\\"The battle was a grinding, protracted affair. In time, even the Guuji began to falter, and the enemy seized that opening, lashing out with great force!\\\"<br/>\\\"Just then, a bolt of lightning descended like a falling star before the Guuji — a glimmering Vision!\\\"<br/>\\\"Grasping it in her hand, the revivified Guuji showed forth her power and...\\\"<br/>\\\"Now wait just a minute! None of what you just said happened, right?\\\"<br/>\\\"Hmm? Well, how about this then? It all started the day when I had a most vicious \\\"Ramen Duel\\\" down in Hanamizaka...<br/>\\\"Oh, come on! Nobody's ever gotten a Vision from eating ramen!\\\"<br/>\\\"But wouldn't that be interesting? I mean, these are the sorts of stories you like to hear, right?\\\"<br/>Yae Miko gave a thin, enigmatic smile as she was faced with the traveler's curiosity.<br/>\\\"After all, would you believe me if I said that 'my Vision is purely ornamental, just for show,' little one? Hardly — not even if it were the truth.\\\"\"}]}\n",

What mischief were you up to last night, hmm?\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... ugh, what a headache. What should I have for lunch?

No one can have everything.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko: Interests\",\"desc\":\"Humans are just fascinating creatures, that's why I'm so fond of them. They live such short lives, but for the time they're around, they shine as bright as the midday sun. There are some whose light never grows dim, even over great stretches of time... These are the lives that make for real page-turners.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Authorship\",\"desc\":\"Boring. Utterly boring...

Don't be taken in by his warm smile. There's no knowing what devious scheme might be brewing inside his head — it's really quite maddening... What do you mean, \\\"sly as a fox\\\"? Hmph, if you're trying to insinuate that he and I are anything alike, you are sorely mistaken.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka\",\"desc\":\"I'm very fond indeed of the Yashiro Commission girl. She adroitly handles every matter that comes before her. Unfortunately, it's often thankless work. Pity. Were she not a member of the Kamisato Clan, I would have long since snatched her up for the Yae Publishing House.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"Not the sharpest tengu in the forest — she certainly didn't inherit the brilliant mind of daddy tengu, that's for sure. *sigh* How shall I put this? I suppose being blunt and dispensing with tact has its own advantages... But I do hope that the next time she visits the shrine, she keeps to herself. I've got better things to do than answer her incessant questions about Ei.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya\",\"desc\":\"Naganohara fireworks are well worth the wait every year. Word is that she caused quite an uproar among the Tenryou Commission recently by setting off fireworks all over the place.

A pity that I couldn't be there to see it for myself.\"},{\"title\":\"About Ganyu\",\"desc\":\"Hmm, now that you mention it, it's been a while since I last saw Ganyu. Before the Sakoku Decree came into effect, the two of us would often meet to discuss bilateral relations between our two nations. I always found her quite reliable.

Hehe, as long as she asked me nicely, of course.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kunikuzushi\",\"desc\":\"I thought it was a disaster waiting to happen at the time, but she insisted that she wasn't going to lift a finger against the object of her own creation.

Well, we're no longer waiting for the disaster to happen, are we?\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto\",\"desc\":\"Ah, the oddball oni. Heh, I hear that he's been quite a pain for the Kujou Clan.

If you ask me, I'd say that Sayu has a secret ally who is helping her hide all the time...\"},{\"title\":\"About Kuki Shinobu\",\"desc\":\"I've heard a lot about Miyuki's little sister. Quite the character, I'm told. Although she comes from a family of shrine maidens, she's gone her own way in life — tried her hand at many different trades, studied abroad in Liyue, even ended up joining the Arataki Gang... Fascinating girl. Maybe I should have Miyuki introduce me. Yes, that'll work — Miyuki wouldn't dream of refusing my request.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yae Miko: I\",\"desc\":\"Oh?

Deal?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yae Miko: II\",\"desc\":\"Kitsune Saiguu said that she was going off on a long trip, and she's never been back since. *sigh* At the time, I wasn't the least bit inclined to take on the burden of managing the Grand Narukami Shrine. So she told me that as Guuji, I would be able to eat all the Fried Tofu I desired. As if that would be a convincing reason... That woman spoke so much nonsense, honestly, she could be so insufferable...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yae Miko: III\",\"desc\":\"I decided to found Yae Publishing House simply because I wished read more interesting light novels, that's all. But, it turns out that seeing frazzled authors scraping the bottom of their barrel in a desperate attempt to get their novels finished is where the real amusement comes from. You wouldn't believe some of the excuses they come up with when they're trying to get a deadline extension. Oh, so much more creative than the novels themselves.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yae Miko: IV\",\"desc\":\"Even supernatural beings eventually pass away, including gods. It's a terrible shame when their tales are lost to time along with them, never to be remembered again. The problem is, only those with first-class writing and composition skills are qualified to commit these stories to paper. If there is no qualified writing talent in the world, we must cultivate it... Yes, home-grown writers are what we need, capable of adequately capturing these stories with the written word.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yae Miko: V\",\"desc\":\"Though I'm an avid reader of novels written by others, I've yet to pick up the pen myself. Writing a novel is quite an undertaking, after all. But, if there comes a day when you reach the end of your adventure and want somebody to record it — and if I happen to have the time when that day comes... We'll see.\"},{\"title\":\"Yae Miko's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My favorite pastime is reading other people's stories. My second favorite is watching other people squirm... If I could find a way to combine the two, haha... Oh, that would be entertainment in its purest form.\"},{\"title\":\"Yae Miko's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"Peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while...\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Have you ever heard of a dish called \\\"Kitsune Udon\\\"?

Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.<br/>The \\\"Tianquan\\\" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. <br/>She is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.<br/>Still, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Up above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the \\\"Jade Chamber,\\\" and it belongs to Ningguang.<br/>On a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.<br/>Whenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of Liyue and quietly mulling everything over.<br/>She is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.<br/>The handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.<br/>For they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Ningguang knows everything,\\\" foreigners will often find the Liyue locals warning them.<br/>Loophole-hunting guilds, market-manipulating hoarders, smugglers coming ashore with their illicit goods... The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.<br/>Once, an alchemist from Sumeru was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain noctilucous jade transaction involving the Blackcliff Forge ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.<br/>Rumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...<br/>The truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.<br/>Between them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.<br/>Once she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.<br/>She understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.<br/>On top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Ningguang's attitude to making money is largely the same as anyone else's: you can never have enough.<br/>But money to her is more than just a sign of wealth — each Mora is a trophy of a hard-won victory.<br/>Ningguang is kind and friendly toward the common folk, but this is a side of her that none of her business associates could ever hope to see.<br/>To her, the business world is a playground, and the zero-sum games are the most exciting. Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.<br/>Every victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.<br/>People often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth.<br/>\\\"Vast wealth is a wonderful thing.\\\"<br/>Ningguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions.<br/>\\\"Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Everyone living in Liyue Harbor has to abide by the rules. Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.<br/>The rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by Morax, Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.<br/>The laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.<br/>Ningguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.<br/>However, there was a certain ship captain by the name of Beidou who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.<br/>As Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.<br/>Outside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as \\\"enacting justice,\\\" \\\"helping the poor\\\" and \\\"keeping the sailors in their jobs.\\\" As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.<br/>In the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Being the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.<br/>It seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the Court of Fontaine signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.<br/>Ningguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance — enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? <br/>Little do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.<br/>The Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.<br/>A portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.<br/>To Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.<br/>Save for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world — because it is infinite.<br/>One day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of Teyvat.\"},{\"title\":\"Chess Game: Liyue Millennial\",\"desc\":\"Ningguang invented a form of chess to pass the time.<br/>This chessboard not only contains to-scale reproductions of Liyue Harbor's natural and urban geography, vendors, tea houses, shops, hotels and miscellaneous stores, but it also contains six, ten and twelve-sided dice (among others.) Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.<br/>The rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.<br/>When she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot — no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.<br/>She marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.<br/>Nonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.<br/>In truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"No one knows how Visions are created — they have always seemed to just appear out of thin air, leaving the countless unacknowledged in the lurch without a clue as to how to get one.<br/>As for Visions left behind after their users die, they are masterless husks without any elemental power, nor is any method of reawakening them known, save for a tiny chance that it may resonate with another — and only one such \\\"other\\\" at a time...<br/>Ningguang's first thought upon seeing such an object a subconscious \\\"oh, look, a new business opportunity.\\\"<br/>Putting this up for sale would surely have the rich shelling out for it. And if they can't resonate with it, why, they'll just use it to keep up appearances. A sound call either way...<br/>And if there should be a way to collect such empty shells, could this not become a long term business?<br/>Playing with the jewel in one hand, Ningguang began writing plans for an auction in the other, her smile widening as she thought about the riches to be had — and at that moment, the Vision shone forth its light.<br/>Ningguang's smile froze as the Vision activated.<br/>Her attendants, coming upon the sight of their mistress, awakened Vision in hand, began to congratulate her on having obtained a priceless treasure.<br/>Ningguang, for her part, seemed annoyed instead.<br/>\\\"What's there to be happy about? Once broken, considered sold!\\\"\"}]}\n",

As wary of him as they may initially be, all are ultimately disarmed by his smooth talking, and end up telling him everything he wants to know.<br/>Depending on what they then make privy to Kaeya, their night may turn into an uncontrollable nightmare or remain one of harmless banter.<br/>\\\"Everyone's got a secret, but not everyone knows what to do with it.\\\"<br/>Says Kaeya, with his usual arrogant smirk.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Justice is not an absolute principle, but is the result of striking that fine balance between strength and strategy. As for the details of how it's done... Don't worry yourself too much about that.\\\"<br/>Kaeya once said these words in front of Grand Master Varka.<br/>As long as everything falls into place the way he expects in the end, Kaeya doesn't care all that much about the means.<br/>This cavalier attitude is what defines his character.<br/>Not so unlike Death After Noon's wild and explosive taste, one might add.<br/>However, his reckless approach to things is not uncontroversial.<br/>Once, in order to force a bandit leader into facing him directly, Kaeya triggered the Ruin Guard at an ancient ruin to cut his opponent off, putting his own men at risk in the process.<br/>It's times like these when even Jean, who puts a lot of trust in Kaeya, finds herself shaking her head in disapproval.<br/>Not that this bothers Kaeya, of course. On the contrary, he actually enjoys putting people into the difficult position of making tough decisions.<br/>He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes in the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"The flourishing winery business in Mondstadt has been a great source of prosperity in the region over the years. This prosperity often entices greedy bandits and monsters to the area.<br/>They are a motley bunch who hide in the shadows, and their backgrounds, motives, and allegiances are varied and complex.<br/>Kaeya battles against this threat to Mondstadt not only with his sword, but also with his smarts and his wit.<br/>A young knight once dedicated years of his life to studying threats in and around Mondstadt, and reached an astounding conclusion:<br/>When Death After Noon is out of season due to lack of supply, the number of reported incidents inside and outside the city show a drastic decrease, and this remains the case until Death After Noon returns to the market...<br/>The young knight showed his findings to Cavalry Captain Kaeya in hopes of getting some advice from him.<br/>\\\"Interesting. I'll look into it.\\\" Kaeya answered, with a wry smirk on his face.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Generally speaking, Kaeya is an easy person to have a conversation with. The only topic that you will never hear him discuss is his past.<br/>Even when the Grand Master demanded information on his background, Kaeya skirted around the issue and gave only vague answers devoid of details.<br/>\\\"One afternoon near the end of summer a decade ago, my father and I passed by the Dawn Winery.\\\"<br/>\\\"'I'll go get us some grape juice for the road,' he said, but he never came back.\\\"<br/>\\\"If Master Crepus hadn't taken me in, I doubt I'd have made it through the storm that night.\\\"<br/>This matter-of-fact description hides a carefully constructed lie.<br/>Kaeya has never once spoken the truth about what happened that afternoon:<br/>\\\"This is your chance. You are our last hope.\\\"<br/>Kaeya's father squeezed his son's lean shoulders as he spoke, seemingly looking right through Kaeya to some place far beyond.<br/>On the other side of the horizon sat their distant homeland of Khaenri'ah.<br/>Kaeya would never forget the look of both hope and hatred in his father's eyes as he uttered those words.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Many citizens still remember the two most eye-catching young gentlemen in all of Mondstadt a few years ago.<br/>One of them was the dapper Diluc, an elegant swordsman who always had a warm smile and a confident posture.<br/>The other was the eccentric Kaeya. He was Diluc's friend, supporter, and sounding board, ensuring he got through every challenge he faced smoothly.<br/>They were almost like twins, knowing each other's thoughts and intentions without a word, protecting Mondstadt in both light and dark.<br/>...Until that fateful day, now ingrained deep in Kaeya's memory, when the convoy that Diluc was escorting was attacked by a huge monster.<br/>It was the first and only time that Kaeya failed in his duty.<br/>By the time Kaeya finally reached Diluc, it was all over.<br/>The power their father had used to successfully fend off the attack backfired, taking their father's life.<br/>Both Kaeya and Diluc were shocked by what they had witnessed, losing the calm composure a knight should retain.<br/>\\\"Even someone like Master Crepus would submit to such a dangerous and evil power...\\\"<br/>Sinister thoughts flashed through Kaeya's mind, and he simply smirked:<br/>\\\"This world is truly... fascinating.\\\"<br/>All while their father lay dead in a pool of his own blood. It was on that night that the two sons' paths diverged.\"},{\"title\":\"A List\",\"desc\":\"Between the pages of \\\"The Adventures of Angelos,\\\" you find a list of names written on a sheet of official Knights of Favonius letterhead paper.<br/>It meticulously records the details of bandits in the city and further afield, as well as mercenaries and mid-to-senior-level Treasure Hoarder members, listing for each entry a name, position, area of activity, and personal profile.<br/>A dozen or so names are circled, with a note in the margin saying \\\"Otherwise, things would get too boring.\\\"<br/>When questioned about it, Kaeya's response is \\\"I suppose I must have gotten drunk and started scribbling nonsense.\\\"<br/>Your gut feeling is that Kaeya purposely let you see this list, but you have no way of proving it.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"It was raining heavily in Mondstadt on the night that Kaeya Alberich received his Vision.<br/>Earlier that day, Crepus Ragnvindr had wielded the power of a Delusion — only to become its victim when it backfired. To set his father free from the unbearable agony, Diluc Ragnvindr took his life.<br/>Kaeya was Diluc's brother by adoption and was always by his side, but on this occasion Kaeya did not partake in the final moments shared between father and son.<br/>The torrential rain that set in on Mondstadt that night seemed to be a sign of the heavens' grief at the passing of Master Crepus.<br/>There was a side to Kaeya that he kept hidden from the world: In truth, he was an agent of Khaenri'ah, placed in Mondstadt to serve their interests. His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.<br/>If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?<br/>For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.<br/>But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance. He felt liberated, but also ashamed of how selfishly he was responding. As an adopted son, he should have saved Crepus, but he had arrived moments too late. As a brother, he should have shared in Diluc's grief, and yet as their father lay dying on the ground, he had hung back behind his brother, that ancient plot running through his mind.<br/>Consumed by guilt, Kaeya knocked on Diluc's door. As the rain poured down, the shroud of secrecy was washed away and all lies were revealed. Kaeya had finally come clean.<br/>He had anticipated Diluc's anger. The brothers drew their blades, this time pointing them at each other. Kaeya felt that this was his punishment for a lifetime of lies.<br/>But as the two crossed blades, Kaeya was overcome by the sensation of great elemental power surging through him. For years, he had stayed out of the way in his brother's shadow. But now, for the first time ever, he was facing his brother as his true self.<br/>Bitterly cold and brittle elemental energy burst forth from the tip of his sword to meet Diluc’s searing flames head-on. The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.<br/>Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.<br/>Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies.\"}]}\n",

Rather than carefully analyzing the economic climate, merchants are more prone to making investments based on belief.<br/>And in present-day Liyue, this is a forgivable strategy: Rex Lapis is a powerful deity and he can be relied on for all things.<br/>But Keqing has her reservations about all this: What if, one day, Rex Lapis stops fulfilling his duty? Then what would become of the people of Liyue?<br/>Liyue's present prosperity is akin to a magnificent sandcastle on the beach — humanity does not have the luxury of deciding when the tide will come in.<br/>However, Keqing has been unable to garner majority support for her views. From most people's perspective, life is but a brief, insignificant moment in Liyue's long history, and there is no point in working oneself up into an existential quandary.<br/>This perspective, as far as Keqing is concerned, is a lazy and cowardly one that denies there is any value at all in the existence of the human race. \\\"If humans really have no value,\\\" Keqing retorts, \\\"then why should we expect the gods to care about us so much?\\\"<br/>Unwilling to compromise on her beliefs, she cast her skepticism on everything — everything from Rex Lapis' loving-kindness, to the people's laziness, to the way that society runs.<br/>Issues affecting humans' fate should be handled by humans, and humans are more than capable of handling them with finesse.<br/>Finally, the day came of her now-famous speech at the Rite of Descension.<br/>\\\"Rex Lapis has watched over Liyue for a millennium. But what about the next millennium? What about the next ten, or the next hundred millennia? How long are we expecting this status quo to last?\\\"<br/>On hearing these words, Rex Lapis burst into hearty laughter. But as for what exactly he was laughing about, only Rex Lapis himself knows.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Some may be able to keep up with Keqing's forward-thinking ideas, but none can keep up with her pace of work.<br/>Perhaps in an effort to become a role model for her people, she demands of herself to work ten times harder than the average person, and she cannot abide any measure of laziness or inefficiency.<br/>Humans' abilities and lifespans are more limited than the gods'. This means that one has no hope of living to see the day when humans replace the gods as masters of our own universe if one allows apathy and hesitation to slow themselves down.<br/>Because of this same mindset, she is never able to synchronize her work rhythm with the people around her.<br/>Whatever the task, she does not rest until the job is done, and when something should take half the month to resolve, she will pull out all the stops to try and get it turned around within the next 48 hours.<br/>Additionally, Keqing's notion of 'completing' something is far more ambitious than simply getting it 'finished' — she will make sure that every relevant detail is tied up too. To the outside observer, she seems to be both highly efficient and a perfectionist.<br/>But not everyone is as self-motivated as Keqing. No assistant she hires ever makes it past the three-month mark.<br/>She has received countless remonstrations urging her to be less impatient, but she meets each one with a stern rejection.<br/>Still, she has, to some extent, come around to the idea that a high staff turnover is itself a manifestation of inefficiency, and made some concessions accordingly.<br/>Today, if you encounter an assistant of Keqing's dealing with some matter three, four, or even five years ahead of time, don't be alarmed, this is completely normal. Keqing gave them a bit of a head start, but she'll be catching up before long.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today.\\\" This is one of the principles Keqing lives by.<br/>Spending all of one's time at Yujing Terrace means seeing the same old things day after day. But to be able to think and act as swiftly as lightning, one needs a huge amount of experience to draw on.<br/>So, if Keqing sees something that needs doing, why, she'll do it herself. For example, she once served for two months as a laborer to better decide how to refine a plan to improve their treatment.<br/>It's hard to imagine that this young lady with so much authority vested in her has pulled carts at the Chasm, rammed earth at the south wharf, and waited tables at small diners.<br/>In addition to working, she also once took the opportunity to gather evidence with which to report a powerful individual known for his abuses.<br/>He was apprehended without any clue as to how he had been exposed, but when he was brought to the interrogation chamber by the Millelith, there he saw a striking young lady dressed in fine robes.<br/>\\\"Hey! Haven't we... haven't we met somewhere before?\\\"<br/>The words felt foolish the moment they rolled off his tongue, even to him.<br/>Especially because the Millelith then introduced her as follows: \\\"This is the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. Know your place and keep your distance!\\\"<br/>—Exactly, so what was he thinking!?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Rex Lapis' departure has put Liyue Harbor through a great deal of hardship. All the duties Rex once fulfilled have been taken up by the Qixing and the Eight Trades.<br/>Now that divine rule is a thing of the past, the old strictures left behind can't simply be continued wholesale. But to establish new laws for Liyue, whose history spans several thousand years, is no mean feat.<br/>At first, Keqing was incredibly enthusiastic about this task, having long prepared for this day when she might finally show her mettle. But several months in, and she was still stuck on a single task, land infrastructure — and it was driving her up the wall.<br/>No matter how hard she struggled, the mountain of tasks was like a quagmire. She was making difference, yes, but not nearly with as much ease as Rex Lapis.<br/>\\\"Why can I only do this much? Why... can't I do it better?\\\"<br/>Of course, she had long understood the wherefores here.<br/>Her lack of respect for gods had somehow received their recognition all the same, yes, but that didn't mean that she was ready to simply replace them.<br/>But she was still Keqing, resolute and tenacious.<br/>From that day on, she shut herself in, studying classics of various kinds to learn all that she needed. Placing herself lowest, she accepted all that she had hitherto not known with open arms.<br/>During this period, she gained a certain calm, slowly discarding the \\\"opprobrium\\\" she had long held against Rex Lapis.<br/>They were both working for the good of Liyue, after all — and two people who love the same thing need not be on opposing sides.<br/>She also seemingly came to an understanding concerning the smile Rex Lapis had given her during that Rite of Descension. It was, Keqing now believes, an expression of acknowledgment and expectation.<br/>She hasn't lost any of her forceful and decisive manner, no. But sometimes, when she feels lost, she will stop and think: \\\"What would Rex Lapis do at a moment such as this?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Keqing, who has dedicated a large portion of her energies to Liyue Harbor, indulges in an unexpected pastime when she can spare a moment — shopping.<br/>On her days off, she changes into ordinary clothes, contacts a few close friends, and enjoys a day of strolling around Feiyun Slope and Chihu Rock, just enjoying the act of buying things.<br/>After Rex Lapis' departure, Keqing managed to maintain this method of decompression despite her busier schedule, though with one subtle difference.<br/>On one of her shopping trips, she happened upon a small and unremarkable stall that sold cute Rex Lapis clay figurines with tiny bodies and big heads.<br/>Persuading her friends to visit the silk store opposite, she approached the stall, took a figurine in her hand, and began to examine it.<br/>She knew that she didn't have much time. So, after glancing around to make sure that no one was watching, she paid for, picked up, and packed away her prize in one swift single movement.<br/>But no sooner had she placed the figurine into her bag and heaved a sigh of relief than one of her friends, silk bundles in tow, tapped her on the shoulder.<br/>In the end, all was revealed. Her friends were quite curious: Wasn't Keqing a skeptic among skeptics? Why would she buy one of these?<br/>\\\"For... For introspection, of course! There's nothing wrong with self-reflection, is there?\\\"<br/>So she said, and it would be convincing, too — if Keqing didn't already have an entire shelf dedicated to Rex Lapis self-reflection memorabilia...\"},{\"title\":\"Survival Hairpin\",\"desc\":\"Though she is of noble birth, Keqing tries to keep her luxuries to the bare minimum that would befit her position as one of the Liyue Qixing.<br/>And when she is outside the borders of the prosperous city, she will often head deep into uninhabited areas to strengthen her knowledge and sharpen her will.<br/>She has experienced countless challenges, but unlike backpackers and adventurers, she does not bring anything with but her hairpin and her sword.<br/>As long as it is infused with Electro, a hairpin can become a knife of unmatched sharpness. Cutting grass, chopping firewood, skinning game and carving bone are all well within its capabilities.<br/>If faced with a drop of great height, she only needs to pin it into the ground, tie rattans to it, and rappel down.<br/>It also serves as an incredibly sensitive security device when camping out. Any unusual movements nearby will cause it, when tipped over and placed perpendicular to the ground, to alert and awaken Keqing immediately.<br/>It can even be used to fish: Keqing just hurls it into the water when she's feeling peckish, and there will always be a few fish that will get knocked out by the electric shock — and of course, finding a stick to grill the fish on is not a problem either.<br/>Some narrow-minded folk have ridiculed Keqing's hairpin for being old and worn, but this does not anger her. Indeed, she considers it a point of pride.<br/>\\\"Its weathered form is what gives it its charm.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Keqing is likely a skeptic without equal when it comes to the value of Visions.<br/>She knows that everything she has is the result of her own hard work, but that in the eyes of others, credit has been given instead to her Vision.<br/>She once believed that this purple crystal had stolen the pride due originally to her, and that it was both a challenge and an insult from the gods.<br/>In fact, she has tried to destroy her Vision countless times — she's left it in a huge fire for three days and three nights, run over it with a minecart full of rocks, and has even hurled it from the heights of the Jade Chamber.<br/>Unfortunately, she has never been successful.<br/>With no options left, and not wanting it to fall into the wrong hands, Keqing was forced to accept the Vision as part of her life.<br/>Over time, Keqing came to appreciate her Vision. She realized that this item did not actually have any divine will imbued within it, and that it also had numerous practical uses. Thus, she decided to make use of it.<br/>\\\"The source of power is far less important than the character of its user.\\\"<br/>Regardless of how she may once have regarded it, Keqing's Vision and its powers have become a part of her.<br/>Thank the Archons she hadn't destroyed it back then, or she'd have regretted it for sure — oh, the hardships of being a pragmatist.\"}]}\n",

Maybe he really IS an expert in everything, and I've got more left to learn than I realized...\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Pursuing\",\"desc\":\"You know why I like you? It's because you don't believe something just because it was said by a god. You make up your own mind.

Yes... You're right! I have plenty of self-confidence in other areas, so why not in this? ...I can catch up with him — I WILL catch up with him! I just need to keep my chin up, keep trying, and keep learning!\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision: Skepticism\",\"desc\":\"If a Vision means the approval of the gods, then I don't see why I should want one. In fact, I find it quite insulting... It's like trying to say everything I've ever achieved is all thanks to the gods looking out for me! Well, I got to where I am today through my own hard work. The gods had nothing to do with it.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision: Reflection\",\"desc\":\"Oh, so... Rex Lapis wanted me to have power beyond the average mortal so that I can be a great leader?

Mostly the feedback is positive, but whenever I propose something like adding an extra hour to the workday, I come up against very strong resistance... I'm too forward-thinking, I suppose. Maybe I should start with a half hour instead?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Souvenir\",\"desc\":\"What do you mean, Geo Archon paraphernalia? ...You're not suggesting my bedroom is full of that stuff, surely? I'm not a child anymore! Although... Okay, I did buy a couple of Rex Lapis figurines recently, but — but, they're just to keep me on the straight and narrow.

For me, Liyue is that boundless sky.\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli\",\"desc\":\"The gentleman from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? Clearly, he's an extremely learned individual, and I do have a lot of respect for him. But his mindset is too traditional for me — he thinks in the same tired old terms as Rex Lapis did...

That said, The Crux Fleet is indispensable to Liyue Harbor. It's a bit of an art, knowing when to enforce the rules and when it's in everyone's interests to be more lenient. Thing is, the Tianquan is supposed to be the one enforcing the rules, but she always seems to be too busy...\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang: Conflict\",\"desc\":\"We do work together, but we couldn't be more opposite personality-wise.

He's the right guy to go to when you can't figure out what's wrong with you. Oh... the rumors, you say? The only one that I know for a fact is true is how disgusting his medicine tastes. It's not just the kids who find it bitter, it's left me with some horrible memories, too!\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiangling\",\"desc\":\"Yeah, the up-and-coming chef from Wanmin Restaurant... I get that she's gifted and everything, I just think her cooking can be a bit hit-or-miss. I was all ready to hire her for a small banquet once, and give her full control over the menu... but the amount of lizard and slime in her sample dishes quickly turned me off that idea!\"},{\"title\":\"About Xingqiu\",\"desc\":\"I've heard his story — he was born into a well-to-do family, but wasn't keen on the family business, so he now devotes his time to being an envoy of justice. I have huge respect for that! Not everyone has the guts to follow their dreams when it means breaking with a long-standing family tradition.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiao\",\"desc\":\"I feel like now that we live in the age of mankind's rule, it's time for the legendary boy-adeptus to be released from duty.

But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages. In the workplace, she'll carry out my instructions to the letter, even when I can tell she has her reservations. It's a good attitude to have as a career professional.\"},{\"title\":\"About Ganyu: Reflection\",\"desc\":\"I find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh... I feel a bit awkward, though, because I used to be openly disparaging of Rex Lapis in front of her... But she doesn't seem to mind, so I guess I've got nothing to worry about...\"},{\"title\":\"About Yun Jin\",\"desc\":\"When you're passing by Heyu Tea House and have to squeeze your way through the biggest crowd you've seen in your life, that's when you know Yun Jin's on stage performing. There's not a merchant in Liyue who wouldn't buy up the place if they had the chance, and Yun Jin is the reason it would be worth every Mora.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Anemo Archon\",\"desc\":\"Since Rex Lapis left us, the question of Liyue's future has been on my mind constantly. In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too. Mondstadt's god is the one who baffles me the most though — how exactly do any of his actions contribute to the longevity of Mondstadt? It's completely beyond me.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yanfei\",\"desc\":\"The way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past. However, it should also be continuously adapted and improved to match the needs of the present. Given that Liyue is about to undergo a radical transformation, legal talent is in great demand. With an assistant like Yanfei, I could spare myself a great deal of trouble.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yelan\",\"desc\":\"Ms. Yelan's ancestors used to serve the Qixing.

But one downside is the growing number of people who are happy to reap the rewards without doing their fair share of the work. The Liyue Qixing did not put in all this effort to create a more prosperous society just so people like them can loaf around.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"It makes no logical sense to be greedy with food, but for me, all rationality goes out the window when there's Golden Shrimp Balls involved...

Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Beidou is something of a cultural icon in Liyue.<br/>Though her fame does not quite reach the same lofty heights as that of the Liyue Qixing, one can be certain that every merchant in the city knows her name — and that of her crew, The Crux.<br/>Naturally, there are rumors abound regarding someone of her status. People love to tell epic tales of her earth-shattering (or rather, sea-splitting) feats.; tales in which her abilities are exaggerated to almost superhuman levels.<br/>One rumor is that she can channel Electro energy with her sword. It is said that she once used it to cut a formidable sea monster from the depths of the ocean abyss in half with just one hit.<br/>Bystanders who overhear such tales generally dismiss them as drunken ramblings. But to any who have ever voyaged with Beidou themselves, these stories are no joke. In their view, if this world really were home to a giant sea monster from the ocean abyss... Beidou would certainly be capable of cutting it in half.<br/>In summary, Beidou's abilities are every bit as impressive as her reputation in business circles. So if you hear her lauded as the Uncrowned Lord of the Ocean — suffice to say that there is no smoke without fire.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Business people tend to put profit before their humanity. This is just accepted as the way of the world; at most, it makes for some light verbal sparring at the dinner table.<br/>But things are different in Liyue, where everyone is involved in business. They reject the notion entirely, claiming that Liyue Harbor is a special place where humanity is sacred.<br/>Foreign merchants will retort that the only thing special about Liyue is that \\\"They've managed to commodify humanity, too!\\\" To this, Liyue locals respond, \\\"Then how do you explain The Crux?\\\"<br/>With The Crux having made a name for itself over many years, their services are extremely expensive to charter. And yet, on one voyage when The Crux encountered a strong storm, Beidou noticed a small private boat nearby. Seeing the way it was tossed about by the waves, she ordered her crew to tow the boat to safety — despite the risk that her ship's keel might give way. What little food and water the fleet had left, Beidou shared with the rescued crew as she navigated her vessel onward through the raging storm.<br/>Finally, after several days, The Crux delivered the rescued boat to a safe mooring spot. Grateful to Beidou for saving their lives, the crew of the rescued boat became her loyal trade partners thereafter.<br/>After Liyue locals recount this story, they smile and insist, \\\"When you have someone risking their life like that, you can be sure that it takes far more than commodification to explain their actions! Would you really dare to look Beidou in the eyes and talk about the commodification of humanity?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Word has it that The Crux's boss behind the curtains is none other than the Qixing's Tianquan, Ningguang, herself.<br/>Both of the people involved deny this outright, though they do so for different reasons.<br/>As a member of the Qixing, Ningguang often needs someone else to do her dirty work for her. Of the many candidates available, she picked Beidou.<br/>Ningguang would emphasize that she picked Beidou, not The Crux; Ningguang's collaboration with The Crux is, therefore, purely incidental.<br/>Meanwhile, when Beidou hears the rumors about her dealings with Ningguang, she furiously insists that she collaborates with Ningguang on an equal footing: Beidou is her own boss and no one, not even Ningguang, is sitting in the background pulling the strings for her.<br/>Beidou is certainly unique among Ningguang's collaborators.<br/>She does not tread carefully or show reverence in the way that most of them do. In fact, one could even say Beidou is sometimes at odds with Ningguang.<br/>Ningguang's advisers worry constantly that Beidou is too unpredictable and too much of a maverick. But Ningguang simply smiles and dismisses their concerns.<br/>\\\"On the contrary, Beidou is the most reliable person in Liyue,\\\" she replies. \\\"Just tell her the truth, as well as what's in it for her, and she'll come around in her own time.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Once, after disembarking from a long voyage, The Crux held its customary three-day celebratory banquet. It was a fall like any other before it — except for the new chef in town.

When she saw Beidou, Xiangling was dismayed, and let Beidou know this in no uncertain terms: \\\"If you want to have Yue-style seafood, then I can't agree to help you. I'll have you know that I intend to transcend Liyue's two warring culinary styles with my cooking...\\\"<br/>Beidou merely smiled and gestured to the chest of gold coins beside her: \\\"Just do what you're good at. We made quite a bit on our last run. How does a retainer of fifty thousand Mora sound?\\\"<br/>Not one to shy away for a chance to prove the worth of her cooking, Xiangling took the job.<br/>When the day was done, Beidou was indeed won over by Xiangling's skill. She declared in front of her crew that Xiangling would soon be a renowned chef throughout Liyue. She also insisted that they refer to her as \\\"Madam Xiangling.\\\"<br/>Having only begun to make her name, Xiangling admired Beidou for her generosity with money and her direct personality. Thereafter, Xiangling would sail with Beidou often, looking for new and exotic seafood ingredients. She found herself surprised by Beidou's vast knowledge of seafood and their culinary preparation, given how far she usually was from any kitchen.<br/>Of course, that didn't mean Xiangling would necessarily heed Beidou's advice on whether something was edible or not...but that is a story for another time.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Some say an object takes after its master.<br/>Though it may not be a suitable description, The Crux crew does indeed take after Beidou, exhibiting the same qualities.<br/>However, there are still secrets among the crew, spreading in places unnoticed by Beidou.<br/>Her First Mate always takes new sailors out after their first safe return for drinks and fills them in on the details of an old story:<br/>In the past, the crew went on a journey to brave the unknown seas and found itself at death's door in a horrific storm.<br/>At that time, Beidou stood on the deck behind the wheel, singing a Liyue fishermen's song in the storm.<br/>\\\"...all the way until the waves died down and dawn broke on the far horizon...\\\"<br/>The First Mate often ends the story with this final line and a look of longing on his face.<br/>As business grew and the crew expanded, more and more outrageously incredible details were added to the story, making the rookies worship Beidou like a goddess.\"},{\"title\":\"Pier Laborers' Gossip\",\"desc\":\"1. Facing a three-headed hydra of unrivaled girth, Beidou hurled forth her greatsword. Spinning in the air, it sliced clean through all three of the hydra's vertebrae, before returning to her waiting hand.<br/>2. Beidou has beaten Ningguang at chess. Twice. The important part is not so much that she did win Ningguang's money, but more that she dared to.<br/>3. Since the day she slew the sea monster Haishan, Beidou has never sung a fishermen's shanty ever again.<br/>4. Yes, Beidou knows shanties. But don't you dare ask her that to her face. I mean, you know how that hydra ended up, don't you...\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Liyue and Inazuma share a common saying: \\\"Its fins formed the ocean deep, its tail the mountains high.\\\" The fishermen learned this phrase while ashore long ago, and sang it over and over, spreading the tune far and wide till it became the much-loved song people know today. Whenever the mists gather over the sea's surface, one can hear the distant song of the fishermen hidden in the white shroud: \\\"its fins formed the oceans deep, its tail the mountains high...\\\"<br/>This was Beidou's childhood lullaby. The tale of Rex Lapis smiting the sea monsters had become legendary among the people of Liyue. As a child, Beidou loved tales like this, and in her dreams, she thought: One day, I want to see this big fish too.<br/>This day, however, she sang this song with a different emotion in her heart. Her entire crew sang along as they sailed.<br/>Haishan was in the waters with them — at once like a dragon and a fish, it was larger than any could have imagined in their worst nightmares, and mighty as a deity, raising waves dozens of meters high with ease.<br/>All who ply their trade on the high seas are destined to meet Haishan eventually. Beidou had longed to do so since she was nine, dreaming of slicing its head off in a single blow.<br/>Many times she had challenged the creature, and many times she had failed. But this day was different. This day she charged at Haishan with her best greatsword in hand, and crack sailors at her back.<br/>The battle would rage fiercely for four days. With cannons and harpoons, arrows and ropes the fleet would assail Haishan, while Beidou battled the thusly tied-down creature for ten hours, well into the night.<br/>Now, nighttime was when Haishan was in its element, and in their vigilance not a single member of the fleet dared sleep a wink. Beidou stood upon the prow, listening to the wind.<br/>One strike. Just one strike. That was all she needed. And so she waited, unmoving, in the freezing wind.<br/>Then, at the crack of dawn, having neither eaten nor drank throughout the night, Beidou heard a change in the sound of the waves.<br/>With one almighty strike that sounded as if it could have sliced the moon in two or ripped a mountain from the face of the world, she chopped the leviathan's head clean off!<br/>The sound of thunder filled the heavens, and a single bolt of purple lightning struck the ocean right in front of Beidou, even as she bathed in the blood of her nemesis.<br/>Thus descended a Vision to the slayer of the sea monster, its violet glow as stunning as lightning, and its immaculate, jeweled form a treasure more precious than dragon blood. A suitably divine gift for the hero who subdued Haishan.\"}]}\n",

She has an innocent passion for explosives, and is incredibly enthusiastic in all that she does.<br/>Under the protection of the Knights of Favonius, she is protected from harm and those of ill intent.<br/>This young girl soon forged an unbreakable bond with everyone in the Knights of Favonius.<br/>Being sent to the solitary confinement room by Jean, helping Amber improving Baron Bunny, as well as developing new bombs...<br/>These parts of Klee's life are all invaluable treasures to her.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...\\\"<br/>Jean sighs to herself as she sits down at her desk, head in hands, faced once again with a stack of damage reports.<br/>Carts blasted beyond repair, storage shacks burnt down, forest fires that the knights barely managed to contain...<br/>Not to mention the suspiciously high number of deaths from unnatural causes among the fish of Starfell Lake.<br/>There's only one potential culprit behind all of this, and she just so happens to be one of their own...<br/>\\\"Klee!\\\"<br/>Faced with Jean's stern glare, the harmless-looking Klee surrenders all her concealed explosives.<br/>She is then escorted to solitary confinement, despite her protests amidst floods of tears.<br/>This occurs about once or twice a week at the Knights of Favonius.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Of course, Klee always tries to help clean up the messes she's made.<br/>However, sometimes her reckless personality makes things worse still.<br/>For example, she once wanted to apologize to everyone by making some BBQ fish, but ended up blowing the stove sky-high.<br/>Then there was the time she got into a fluster and tried to put the fire out... with wind — which obviously resulted in the whole plain going up in flames.<br/>Klee is not a bad kid by nature, it's just that her curious and playful nature always results in her failing to think before she acts.<br/>And every time she gets into trouble, she guiltily tries to make up for it.<br/>Though once Jean lets Klee out of solitary confinement, there's usually no more than a day or two before the sound of explosions return to Mondstadt.<br/>The \\\"Spark Knight\\\" always manages to live up to her title in a range of unexpected ways.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Though Klee always ends up causing trouble for the Knights of Favonius and Mondstadt, she isn't just some rookie who drags the team down.<br/>On the contrary, her skills with explosives can be quite handy if applied correctly.<br/>Once, Jean was able to defeat a horde of invading hilichurls utilizing Klee's special talents alone.<br/>However, Klee also forever changed the face of Stormbearer Mountains in that same operation due to recklessly placing too many charges...<br/>Needless to say, everyone was more than a little shocked, but at least no one from the Knights of Favonius was injured.<br/>Since then, the legend of the \\\"Red Knight of the Stormbearer Mountains\\\" began to circulate around Mondstadt.<br/>Rumor has it that she is cloaked in red, and clutches the greatest treasure the Knights of Favonius have.<br/>However, only Klee knows what this \\\"treasure\\\" truly is.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"To Klee, the Knights of Favonius are family, and she can't imagine life without them.

Aloy had many identities in her original world, and she was destined on account of her genetics to be the heroine who would heal it.<br/>Now, she has arrived in a new world, full of never-before-seen challenges, and once again, she throws herself gladly into the hunt.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Aloy was born an outcast, deeply rejected and feared by her tribe. She was raised in the rugged mountains near their tribal dwellings by the experienced Hunter, Rost.<br/>He taught her how to hunt: to have cat-like form and deadly accuracy. And yet, he could not pass the most important thing onto her — the truth of her birth. Who were her parents? Why had she been cast out?<br/>Unfortunately, the reasons for this were known only to the very High Matriarchs of the tribe who had exiled her.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"There was only one way to discover the identity of Aloy's parents — victory at the Proving, the tribe's annual hunting contest, in which the victor would be free to ask for a reward.<br/>She would train hard all her life for that event, but when the moment of trial came, the ritual would end in tragedy.<br/>Mysterious assassins slew the participating Hunters, and it was only through Rost's sacrifice that Aloy was able to escape.<br/>Later, Aloy would learn that she was the true target of the attack, for she had almost exactly the same face as an enigmatic, ancient woman.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Aloy knew that she had to find these killers to understand her origins.<br/>Her pursuit brought her into a wild and dangerous world far beyond her imagination, bringing strange and powerful tribes, mysterious ancient ruins, and terrifying enemies — whether human or machine — before her.<br/>In the end, the true enemy, HADES, appeared before her. It was an artificial intelligence filled with malice, bent on cleansing the world of all life.<br/>There was only one way to defeat HADES: investigate her link with that ancient woman, that \\\"Aloy from the past\\\"... Or could she have been her mother?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Hot on HADES' trail, Aloy traversed a great many ruins from the distant past, and ultimately discovered her origin: she was not born of human flesh and blood but was the result of cloning.<br/>The genetics of the woman who had saved all life 1,000 years ago had been the basis for her creation.<br/>This had not only granted her the abilities she had possessed since birth, but had also guided her destiny, for this genetic material was the key to preventing the second coming of the apocalypse.<br/>Armed with this knowledge, and with the help of allies from many tribes, Aloy was finally able to defeat HADES and its human and machine minions in a decisive battle in the shining city of Meridian.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"After defeating HADES, Aloy embarked on a new journey, pursuing ancient technologies and cleansing the land that HADES had trampled underfoot.<br/>In her long journey, she found every Old World Ruin that there was to be found in search of the Old Ones' lost secrets.<br/>In one ancient, dilapidated laboratory, she found something she had never seen before — a gleaming portal. As she drew close, she was enveloped by powerful energies, and she saw her own image within the portal as one looking into a mirror, feeling as if she were in two places at once.<br/>With a flash of light, the \\\"world\\\" that Aloy knew completely disappeared from her sight, and she now found herself in a strange, beautiful new world just waiting to be explored.\"}]}\n",

In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with her responsibilities.<br/>It takes a newcomer only a few days to feel right at home with this passionate girl.<br/>Whether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find traces of this vigilant Outrider in red anywhere. <br/>Once spotted by her, no suspicious individual can ever escape her interrogation.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"From a young age, Amber has always had boundless energy and a positive outlook on life.<br/>Each day, she burns with a fiery enthusiasm that sees her go about her life like a whirlwind, smashing through any obstacle that stands in her way.<br/>At times, however, her excessive energy can make her quite the troublemaker.<br/>Needless to say, she was quite a handful when she was young. Her infamous deeds include accidentally dropping a bird's nest on her grandpa's head while trying to steal the eggs from it and setting a Dendro Slime's leaves on fire, causing it to scurry about like a wild animal. These minor offenses gained her some notoriety among hunters' camps.<br/>Somehow, Amber was always able to escape the scene of the crime whenever she caused an incident, and not even a veteran outrider could catch up with her. Invariably, it was Amber's grandpa who ended up on damage control duty each time his granddaughter's misbehavior caused yet another incident.<br/>To Amber, her grandpa's silent, unconditional love was like a warm breeze that wrapped around her like a blanket. She knew that it was because of this love that he accepted her and took responsibility for her deeds, and she embraced it silently.<br/>But it was only on the day that her grandpa resigned from the Knights of Favonius that she finally understood the full extent of the responsibility he had borne all those years.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Amber's grandpa was once the leader of a mercenary group. He came from Liyue Harbor and was tasked with protecting merchant caravans as they traversed Teyvat. One day, on a routine escort job, the caravan fell prey to a savage monster attack; he was the only survivor, saved by a doctor from the Knights of Favonius.<br/>Too ashamed to return home and anxious to repay the debt, Amber's grandpa joined the Knights of Favonius.<br/>Before long, he single-handedly founded the Outriders, trained each one of them personally, and began leading them on missions.<br/>It also wasn't long before he found love in the foreign land of Mondstadt and founded a family.<br/>Years later, Amber was born into that family. During the day, she would crouch by the window and secretly watch him training the outriders; at night, she would sneak into the yard and practice the moves he had taught that day.<br/>Amber's grandpa was touched by her enthusiasm, and decided to teach her everything he knew.<br/>\\\"When Mondstadt accepted me, it became my homeland. Then, I decided to watch over this new home of mine. Maybe one day, you will inherit this responsibility... Hah, but then, who knows what the future holds?\\\"<br/>As the coarse skin of her grandpa's palm rubbed against her head, a bewildered but earnest Amber nodded energetically in response.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Something happened one day four years ago that profoundly changed Amber.<br/>That day, her grandpa left his coat of arms and sword in his office and simply disappeared, leaving no note and telling no one he was leaving.<br/>He had been the beating heart and the backbone of the Outrider division, and without his leadership they rapidly became undisciplined and lost their edge.<br/>A few failed operations later, the Outrider division was facing obsoletion. In the end, it was preserved as a part of the Knights' organization, but in name only. Experienced members either transferred to another detachment or resigned, and so few outriders stayed that they simply did not have enough people to fulfill their daily patrol duties.<br/>On top of this, rumors that Amber's grandpa had defected made recovery even more difficult for the struggling Outrider division.<br/>Amber personally experienced this entire episode, having just been admitted to the Outriders before it all began. With the decline of her squad, she experienced true loss and disappointment for the first time in her life. No longer her carefree former self, she was filled with a new determination: She was going to grow up and become a true outrider as quickly as possible, no matter what it took.<br/>She had never made an actual plan before, and lacked the maturity to know where to start. But what she did have was confidence and courage — and lots of it.<br/>She wanted to show she had inherited her grandpa's determination, and she wanted to find out where he had gone.<br/>But more importantly, she wanted to inherit her grandpa's former role and become a loyal protector of her homeland.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Life in the Knights of Favonius was not easy for Amber in the beginning.<br/>Being as young as she was and having just lived through the trauma of losing her grandpa, the senior knights made a point of taking special care of her.<br/>However, for a girl as desperate to excel as she was, being taken care of by others implied that she wasn't yet mature enough to stand on her own two feet.<br/>Accordingly, she voraciously sought out extra responsibilities and made this as visible as possible to her seniors.<br/>Finally, during an intense engagement with some monsters, the seniors noticed her bravery and resourcefulness in the heat of battle.<br/>That was the moment when they realized that their little girl was growing up.<br/>As she matured, she also became more at ease with herself. Whatever feedback she met with, be it praise, rebuke, silence, or taunting, her response was always the same.<br/>\\\"For sure, I may still have a way to go before I catch up with my seniors. But one day, I'm gonna be the best Outrider ever!\\\"<br/>Amber is not prone to too much deliberation, preferring instead to speak her mind, truthfully and frankly, at every occasion.<br/>She firmly believes that she will not disappoint her grandpa.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Today, Amber is still the firecracker she always was, burning with endless passion and energy.<br/>Now that she's all grown up, Amber holds firm to her grandpa's teachings as she spreads her Wind Glider's wings and watches over the City of Freedom with the eye of an eagle and the cautious cunning of a bunny rabbit.<br/>The \\\"Crimson Knight\\\" is known throughout Mondstadt.<br/>The people are delighted to see the mischievous little girl they remember growing up to be a guardian they can rely on.<br/>\\\"Never fear, Outrider Amber is here!\\\"<br/>Her self-confidence is simply unshakable:<br/>\\\"I am Outrider Amber, the one and only outrider — which makes me the best one out there!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Amber's Journal\",\"desc\":\"Amber doesn't make writing a daily diary a habit, only electing to write special or memorable events down in her journal.<br/>\\\"I finally caught that magical bird! It's called a Rami... something. I don't remember. But I've been chasing it for three days, and I've only been able to sit down for a proper meal today. That magical bird was a really cunning one, burrowing in the thick forest like that. Good thing I didn't give up! Best of all, Master Jean gave me special permission to pluck a feather plume from it as my reward. Hehe, I'll wear it at my side every single day!\\\"<br/>\\\"I'm sure I followed the cookbook to the letter and grilled the meat for six minutes. But while the outside is charred, the inside isn't cooked yet... Did I not control the heat properly? But I really am hungry, so I'll just have to try again tomorrow. One day, I'll make the best steak, and I'll call it... the Outrider's Champion Steak!\\\"<br/>\\\"I met a strange outlander today. I was suspicious at first, but as it turns out, this outlander is both reliable and capable. Ugh, come to think of it, what would I do if an enemy that strong showed up? ...I musn't fall behind. I must train harder!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Amber once believed that if she took on her grandpa's post, she would understand why he left Mondstadt.<br/>However, even when she officially became an Outrider, she was no closer to unraveling the mystery behind his wordless departure.<br/>Her grandpa had left nothing for her to find either, indicating that she would have to forge her own path.<br/>Amber floundered for a while, until she flipped through an old book of fables that she would eventually come to treasure.<br/>\\\"What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world.\\\"<br/>Amber realized that she shouldn't wait for directions from someone else, but that she should be like those courageous birds that spread their wings and flew into the blue skies.<br/>\\\"There must be something that only I can do. There must be.\\\"<br/>The moment she realized this, a Vision began to shine brightly at her hip.\"}]}\n",

Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"To Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.<br/>The various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.<br/>Over a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with \\\"commemoration\\\" as the theme.<br/>The fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show.<br/>In latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.<br/>During the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.<br/>The year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.<br/>On the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: \\\"Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mistudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would.\\\"<br/>\\\"Haha, just wait for it!\\\" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.<br/>Before the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.<br/>Yet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.<br/>It was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an \\\"angling\\\" trick added to it.<br/>If viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.<br/>Of course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.<br/>With Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, \\\"Queen of the Summer Festival,\\\" coined.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.<br/>However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.<br/>If chatting with the guest is her way of \\\"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\\\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...<br/>Yoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.<br/>She doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.<br/>Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.<br/>What she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.<br/>After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.<br/>Yoimiya puts it this way: \\\"I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Craftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.<br/>Sometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...<br/>Her neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.<br/>Fortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.<br/>At some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.<br/>Perhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.<br/>Living as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.<br/>Of course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her \\\"official business.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Apart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.<br/>All manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.<br/>From the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.<br/>They are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.<br/>Yoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.<br/>Many people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, \\\"Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all,\\\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"\\\"The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.\\\"<br/>This nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.<br/>As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.<br/>Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the \\\"rainbows\\\" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them \\\"sufficiently shiny,\\\" whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.<br/>Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.<br/>But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that \\\"rainbows\\\" could indeed be exchanged for \\\"fireworks.\\\"<br/>Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.<br/>\\\"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.\\\"<br/>The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...<br/>Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.<br/>The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.<br/>Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.\"},{\"title\":\"Yoimiya's Candy Box: \\\"Sweet Pearl\\\"\",\"desc\":\"Every festival, Yoimiya not only tries snacks from every store, but she also collects all sorts of candies, wraps them up with care, before storing them away inside a small candy box.<br/>Yoimiya's candy box is a small crimson ball that has been decorated with delicate lanyards and ornate accessories, much like the hair accessories she often wears.<br/>Each time she encounters a joyous event, she will take one candy out of the box and eat it. If her friends or the children are around, she will share the sweets with them.<br/>Yoimiya's neighbors often mistake her hair ornaments for the candy box, hence its erroneous nickname \\\"Sweet Pearl.\\\"<br/>The speed at which the box lightens is taken for an important measure of happiness.<br/>The quicker it empties, the more pleased Yoimiya is.<br/>Sometimes, when things get busy, she sometimes absently uses the candy box as a hair accessory, realizing her mistake only after the day is done.<br/>Still, even this error would inspire Yoimiya. From then on, she would wear them interchangeably.<br/>\\\"Take a guess: does my hair ornament have candy in it today? Free pick of the sweets to anyone who gets it right!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Yoimiya is always up for a chat. It is only when the fireworks are ascending into the skies that she quiets down and just watches the lovely scenery.<br/>People often say that fireworks come and go in a fleeting heartbeat, but if they are memorable enough, they will remain in bloom forever in people's hearts.<br/>Those who accompanied you and the loveliness of the moment itself, will burrow deep into your mind as a beautiful memory.<br/>And as you look upon the same fireworks, many years later, that same memory and the feelings that came with it will surely rise again to the forefront of your heart.<br/>Is this not also \\\"Eternity\\\"?<br/>The special firework formula slips that belong solely to the Naganohara family exist for precisely this purpose.<br/>By incorporating goodwill and wishes into the gorgeous fireworks, ephemeral things are etched into eternity. This is the meaning of Yoimiya's line of work.<br/>On one summer night following her taking over Naganohara Fireworks, Yoimiya could not sleep, and thus she continued in her research till daylight came.<br/>Suddenly, she heard a tinkling sound, and a burning-red object fell into an unused launching tube.<br/>At first, Yoimiya used her Vision as a sort of lighter. Fortunately, her father discovered it and explained a Vision's significance to her.<br/>So, this tiny gem could grant a person astonishing and mysterious powers. And yet what else could it do other than protect the children or chase some mischievous monsters away?<br/>\\\"Even if it could have other uses,\\\" Yoimiya thought, \\\"it may not ever need to do these things in my hands. I'm just someone who pursues happiness, a fireworks-maker who enjoys living life.\\\"<br/>Time has flown since then, and Yoimiya has grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of \\\"fire,\\\" with her skill at making fireworks having likewise increased.<br/>Sometimes, she stops to ask herself this: \\\"How did someone as ordinary as me receive the acknowledgment of the gods? Do the gods... enjoy fireworks, by any chance?\\\"\"}]}\n",

Hehe, the answer is... to watch them again in your dreams, of course! Good night. See you tomorrow!\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya: Family Matters\",\"desc\":\"My father's hearing isn't very good. When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya: Talking\",\"desc\":\"I don't worry about \\\"loose lips sinking ships.\\\" The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie. Misunderstandings that arise from saying things wrongly can be resolved if you just talk more, but if you say nothing, the other person won't understand what you mean, and they can't get closer to you.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Rock, Paper, Scissors\",\"desc\":\"Let's have a game of rock paper scissors!

When I'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. Talking to you never gets old, after all.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Lantern Rite\",\"desc\":\"Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue.

How can there be festivals without fireworks?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Cycles\",\"desc\":\"\\\"When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence.\\\" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Spots of Light\",\"desc\":\"Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, \\\"Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on...\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the \\\"Goldfish Fireworks\\\" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun\",\"desc\":\"Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the \\\"eternity\\\" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has \\\"eternity\\\" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness\",\"desc\":\"We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word \\\"ladylike\\\" was practically made just for her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths\",\"desc\":\"We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma\",\"desc\":\"He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko\",\"desc\":\"Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, \\\"isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?\\\" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release the fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto: Duels\",\"desc\":\"Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang\",\"desc\":\"Arataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!\"},{\"title\":\"About Sayu\",\"desc\":\"Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!\"},{\"title\":\"About Klee\",\"desc\":\"Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?\"},{\"title\":\"More about Yoimiya: I\",\"desc\":\"You wanna hear a story? Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of — the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?\"},{\"title\":\"More about Yoimiya: II\",\"desc\":\"Our family has a long tradition in which we will give every client who orders customized fireworks a note. Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Yoimiya: III\",\"desc\":\"The loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Yoimiya: IV\",\"desc\":\"Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Yoimiya: V\",\"desc\":\"I shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning.\"},{\"title\":\"Yoimiya's Hobbies: Playing\",\"desc\":\"Fireworks! Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie. I like to chat with the neighbors, I like going to summer festivals with the children, swimming, picking wild fruits... Oh, I can't decide which I like most...

When he first arrived in Inazuma, he relied on his insight and communication skills to make friends with people in various industries. Later, many people would take the initiative to get to know Thoma.<br/>The more people you know, the more resources you can get. Thoma would learn a lot of first-hand information from them, or quietly strike \\\"deals\\\" that are beneficial to the Yashiro Commission.<br/>However, although Thoma has a vast network of contacts, he has never used it for personal gain, nor has he ever forced others to do things in the name of the Yashiro Commission.<br/>Sociability, precise judgment, and just the right amount of tact. Perhaps this is the reason why Thoma can thrive as a \\\"fixer\\\" in Inazuma.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Surprisingly, the handsome and cheerful Thoma has no resistance when it comes to cute animals.<br/>When Thoma's out, he always carries some small snacks for animals, and feeds stray cats and dogs when he sees them.<br/>It never fails to make him smile seeing animals scarf food down.<br/>To Thoma, these animals, like himself, are part of what makes up the world.<br/>Even if they don't seem to be eye-catching, they are still trying to live.<br/>As long as you live, good things will always happen...

He would be in a very happy mood when faced with a clean and tidy Yashiro Commission.<br/>Perhaps it's the sense of accomplishment that comes with cleaning. Whenever he has the chance, Thoma will pick up a broom or duster and sweep away any unsightly stains.<br/>In addition, he also takes special care of the daily lives of his colleagues around him.<br/>There was a winter when Inazuma's temperature suddenly dipped, and a guard of the Yashiro Commission accidentally caught a cold while out on patrol. A few days later, he unexpectedly received a sweater hand-knitted by Thoma.<br/>The sweater that was just the right size made the guard think back to the clothes he received from his mother every winter. Now that his mother was old, she hadn't sent him clothes for many years.<br/>With this in mind, the guard took a long leave of absence to visit his family. The day he came back, he brought Thoma a special souvenir from his hometown, and they became good friends.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Thoma's father is an Inazuman and his mother is a Mondstadter.<br/>Thoma grew up in Mondstadt and has been accustomed to its carefree and happy atmosphere since he was young.

Fortunately, he just drifted unconscious down the water until he drifted to a beach on Inazuma.<br/>At that time, Thoma had nothing and no family with him, but still started his life in Inazuma with optimism.<br/>However, despite his best efforts, he was unable to find his father, who was supposed to be in Inazuma.<br/>But at his most difficult moment, Thoma met someone in Inazuma who was worthy of his \\\"loyalty\\\" to the end.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Due to him hailing from Mondstadt, Thoma is often regarded as an \\\"outsider\\\" by the local residents of Inazuma.<br/>Despite the strange looks and gossip directed towards him, Thoma never showed any dissatisfaction, and always smiled at all doubts.<br/>Thoma is recognized as the most amiable person in the Yashiro Commission, but to outsiders, it is another story.<br/>\\\"Don't offend Thoma! Otherwise, things will be difficult to handle.\\\"<br/>No one is sure when it started, but this saying has gone around that many people are convinced of this when they hear it.<br/>As for those who have had unpleasant run-ins with Thoma, the mention of him still brings lingering fear:<br/>\\\"Don't be fooled by that guy! He's always smiling kindly, but all I did was cheat the Yashiro Commission of a small sum of money, and he...\\\"<br/>That's right, if anyone dares to harm the interests of the Yashiro Commission or disrespect the Kamisato siblings, Thoma will make them pay.<br/>He sees this as his duty and does his best, but does not like to boast about his achievements. Even if he is criticized for this, he will not defend himself too much.<br/>\\\"Gee, who cares about such trivialities? And it doesn't matter what kind of person I am, as long as those who should know know it.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Old Duster\",\"desc\":\"Thoma's favorite duster has been with him in many \\\"conquests\\\".<br/>As it has been used for too long, no matter how Thoma cleans and takes care of it now, it still looks old and gray. Despite this, Thoma is still reluctant to discard it.<br/>This duster was given to Thoma when he was first assigned cleaning duties at Yashiro Commission. As soon as he sees it, he recalls those hard but happy times.<br/>At that time, Thoma had yet to comprehend various cleaning techniques. Due to his lack of experience, he was often busy doing all kinds of cleaning and tidying work until late at night.<br/>Accompanying him were the moonlight above his head, the chirping of insects in the summer night, and the sound of a duster tapping on the beams.<br/>There are many different kinds of cleaning. From a simple cleaning to an all-out deep cleaning, Thoma has experienced it all.<br/>At first, he found the work boring, but after he got used to it, he found that he could think more quietly when cleaning.<br/>So to this day, Thoma often uses this duster to perform his work.<br/>While brushing away the dust in front of him, he also brushed away the fog in his head in a quiet and steady state of mind.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"In his early years living in Mondstadt, Thoma did not have particularly strong aspirations.<br/>Each day, he is awakened by the early morning sun and the fresh fragrance of flowers. After breakfast, he can choose to take a relaxing stroll through the city or explore the wilderness freely.<br/>At that time, Thoma thought that people should have the happiness of living a leisurely life. Perhaps it would have been better to live a peaceful life.<br/>This calm mood disappeared the moment when he was swept into a strange country by the waves, across the ocean in a small boat.<br/>Here, he had to receive a favor to survive, and thus the thought of \\\"repayment\\\" arose.<br/>Ten years ago, when the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan was losing its power.<br/>Kamisato Ayato, who was embroiled in the dispute over the succession rights of the clan due to the death of both parents, told Thoma:<br/>\\\"Now that the situation in Inazuma is unclear, the trouble the Kamisato Clan faces will only increase. You are someone who can see what's at stake, so if you don't want to get involved, leave early.\\\"<br/>Could Thoma, who had received so many favors from the Kamisato Clan, just leave like that? Choosing to leave would mean that he would have to return to his ordinary, stable life with regrets and guilt.<br/>The storm was imminent, and Thoma was like a leaf drifting in the sea.<br/>But after much deliberation, Thoma's answer was:<br/>\\\"If I leave at this time, I will lose my loyalty and righteousness. Father has always taught me to be a loyal and righteous man... I would like to do my best to do my part for the young master and the young lady. The path you will take in the future will certainly need me as a helper.\\\"<br/>The will to burn for loyalty and righteousness forged a strong desire that drew the attention of the gods.<br/>As if to respond to Thoma's choice - on this night of divergent destinies, a Vision, bright red like a blaze appeared beside him.\"},{\"title\":\"\",\"desc\":\"\"}]}\n",

There's none for me...\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"Come quick, we gotta get down to the market — they slash the prices on fish around this time of day.

You had a busy day today, you should get some rest, too. Don't stay up late.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma: Housekeeper\",\"desc\":\"It was never Ayaka or Ayato's intention to make me the housekeeper, I volunteered. I like this kind of work. Putting everything in order gives me a great sense of achievement, and based on everyone's reactions... Yeah, I think I do a pretty good job.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma: Meaning\",\"desc\":\"For me, housework is about keeping a space clean and tidy, so that everyone who lives there has a smile on their face.

Or did you just want some space?\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Oath\",\"desc\":\"If you hadn't put yourself out there during the Vision Hunt Ceremony and taken on the Raiden Shogun all by yourself, I would've lost my Vision, and with it all my aspirations.

I certainly don't plan on losing mine.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share\",\"desc\":\"I've gotten to know all kinds of people over the years, and I'd say that Inazumans are more particular about etiquette than Mondstadters. If you make sure you're always polite to people, it's much easier to get things done.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things: Tanuki\",\"desc\":\"I've always wanted to see a tanuki shapeshifting. They say it can change into all kinds of things, and that it likes to play pranks on passersby. It's a creature with a sense of humor, that's for sure.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things: Animals\",\"desc\":\"Are you an animal person, too? If you are, let me take you to the outskirts some time, it's great. I just need to give a whistle, and all these puppies and kittens will come out of nowhere and start strutting around your ankles, clamoring for your affection. Haha, just imagining it is already brightening my day.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko\",\"desc\":\"Lady Miko? Wh—What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N—Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha...\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun: Comparison\",\"desc\":\"In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown\",\"desc\":\"Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.<br/>The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach.\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"The captain of The Crux — a formidable woman indeed. She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer...\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayato\",\"desc\":\"As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka\",\"desc\":\"Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya\",\"desc\":\"Of Naganohara Fireworks fame? She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks. Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note — here, have a coupon!\"},{\"title\":\"About Sayu\",\"desc\":\"Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... Word on the street is that he's quite a character — apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!\"},{\"title\":\"About Shikanoin Heizou\",\"desc\":\"Ho, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth.\"},{\"title\":\"About Jean\",\"desc\":\"Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct... Oh, just the \\\"Acting\\\" Grand Master? Haha, well, someone of her standing won't care about titles.\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula\",\"desc\":\"You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Thoma: I\",\"desc\":\"Anything I can lend a hand with? If something needs doing around the house or you're having some interpersonal strife, just say the word. Hmm? A conversation... I see, I see. That's a little different from what I'm used to, but I'm all for it.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Thoma: II\",\"desc\":\"I'm not from Inazuma originally — I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Thoma: III\",\"desc\":\"I get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Thoma: IV\",\"desc\":\"For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Thoma: V\",\"desc\":\"I'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?\"},{\"title\":\"Thoma's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating. Before that, I was really into ninjutsu for a while, and before that... Hmm? You think I'm not dedicated enough? N—No! It's not like that, you got me all wrong!\"},{\"title\":\"Thoma's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"I'm in a real pickle here. The chief is hosting a banquet for his friends tonight, and he says he wants me to splurge a little by cooking some Butter Crab. The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Without a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"As far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Quick, come with me! I remembered it's your birthday, obviously, so I thought I'd throw you a proper party. There's food, there's drinks, and I invited a whole bunch of your friends, too. Hey, this is your birthday we're talking about! I wasn't about to let you spend it all alone!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Really? This'll make me stronger?

I need to give this one some serious thought.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"Thank you for placing your trust in me. Your kindness warms my heart more than the brightest flame ever could. But not to worry, I've figured out what I want to do now. My strength is your shield, and I will always be here to protect you.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Fire it up!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Check this out~\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Don't get too close!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Here's backup.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Supporting fire!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"I got you covered.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Ooh, what's in here?\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Mm!

In fact, the Shuumatsuban is a secret organization under the Yashiro Commission.<br/>There is also a little ninja who goes by the name of Sayu in the Shuumatsuban, and this fact is even less known.<br/>Sayu is a special existence in the Shuumatsuban. She has been raised in the Shuumatsuban since she was a child, and is extremely loyal to the organization.<br/>That said, her most prominent trait is not \\\"loyalty\\\", but \\\"laziness.\\\"<br/>Lazing around is what Sayu does best. She has long mastered the various arts of ninjutsu, particularly those that help her to slack off or shirk her duties, such as escape techniques and aura concealment.<br/>People who don't know about her habits will have to make a lot of effort to find her.<br/>However, if you ask Sayu about her slacking, she will shrug and reply, \\\"It's not that I'm lazy, I just want to spend my time on more meaningful things.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Sayu is petite and can even be described as delicate.<br/>This is also something that bothers her —<br/>One by one, her peers are growing taller, but she still has the stature of a child, as her height has not changed at all.<br/>Sayu is really anxious about this matter.<br/>Day by day, the world seems to be sprouting skyward, and only she remains small as ever.<br/>Growing taller has gradually become an obsession in Sayu's mind.<br/>\\\"As long as I sleep long enough, I can definitely grow taller!\\\"<br/>She came to believe this ever so firmly, seizing every opportunity to sleep as much as possible, creating every opportunity and circumstance, even when there were none.<br/>People around little Sayu often let her be, as they don't have the heart to disturb her sleep.<br/>So now, the situation has progressed such that Sayu is able to fall asleep, even whilst standing.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"The ninjutsu that Sayu has learned is not very powerful in combat, but it is quite useful in the matter of slacking off.<br/>She is extremely skilled at hiding and covering her tracks, and is an expert in this area. Therefore, if she has the intention to hide, ordinary people absolutely cannot find her.<br/>However, even the most ingenious puzzles have answers, and even the most elusive treasures have clues for people to find them. This also holds true for Sayu.<br/>After spending enough time with Sayu, one will understand her habits and preferences. Trying to find her doesn't seem so difficult anymore.<br/>For example, if you go to Sayu's room early in the morning and lift the covers, the odds are that you will find her in bed.<br/>At noon, you can check out the trees near the shrine and who knows, you may find something unexpected.<br/>It will be more challenging to find Sayu at night, but it's a good idea to go to her house and wait for her to emerge.<br/>However, please remember not to disturb Sayu, who is busy growing taller, unless it is absolutely necessary.<br/>Even gentle rabbits bite when provoked, let alone Sayu...\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"That said, finding Sayu doesn't mean that she can be put to work quietly.<br/>Moreover, Sayu's work at the Shuumatsuban is not that of a fixed daily routine, but missions that pop up if and as needed.<br/>And so, this happens:<br/>When new missions are assigned, you won't see hide or tail of her.<br/>By the time she has been found (and with much effort), a more suitable person has been assigned for the mission.<br/>And in case there is no other suitable candidate other than Sayu, all the more she will try to slip away, so as not to be overwhelmed by the mission.<br/>It's just that... If Sayu used her ninjutsu to work hard, she would have had great accomplishments in the Shuumatsuban.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Sayu is the last successor to the Ninjutsu Art — Yoohoo Art.<br/>In this school of ninjutsu, which is known for teasing its enemies, Sayu has learned only ninjutsu such as escape and clone techniques.<br/>These ninjutsu are of little use in actual combat, but have an undeniable aesthetic flair.<br/>Amongst falling leaves, a silhouette vanishes in a flash, a gentle breeze blows, and a kite suddenly appears on the ground... The incredible scene is comparable to an artistic performance.<br/>Thus, whenever there is a festival, Sayu will be invited by various parties to perform her mysterious ninjutsu.<br/>If it's Yoimiya who's searching for her, Sayu can still find ways to hide.<br/>But if the person in question is Lady Guuji Yae, resistance is futile for Sayu.<br/>Clone techniques do nothing to fool the Lady Guuji's sharp eyes, and aura concealment doesn't help Sayu at all in escaping from the Lady Guuji's grasp.<br/>Running for the hills is even less feasible, and might even risk angering the Lady Guuji...<br/>Fortunately, there are very few circumstances that require Lady Guuji Yae to make a personal appearance.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"For as long as Sayu can remember, she has been studying ninjutsu with her sensei in the Shuumatsuban.<br/>Although the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine organization, the elders are very kind and have taken good care of young Sayu.<br/>\\\"Being overly reliant on others is never a good thing for a ninja.\\\"<br/>After Sayu had reached a bottleneck in learning ninjutsu, her sensei observed her situation and thought thusly.<br/>As the years passed, Sayu grew steadily. Once she was capable enough to defend herself, her sensei chose to leave quietly.<br/>A young animal that leaves the protection of its parents will grow up rapidly. The same is true of the sensei's expectations for Sayu.<br/>The young ninja did not disappoint her sensei. Soon after, Sayu obtained a Vision.<br/>And then, she started working diligently in the Shuumatsuban... diligently shirking her duties.<br/>Sayu is always busy sleeping and hiding from people, so in that sense, she also has a lot to do.<br/>Occasionally, when Sayu is free and alone to enjoy the moonlight, she feels lost deep inside.<br/>The people who have always been with you will one day leave...is this how life is meant to be?<br/>But perhaps someday in the future, I will also meet the person who will always be with me.<br/>Pondering the matter, the little ninja fell asleep again...\"},{\"title\":\"Mini Mujina\",\"desc\":\"Sayu's outfit is said to be a gift from her sensei.<br/>The style references the form of a small animal — the \\\"mujina,\\\" and Sayu's favorite colors were also specially chosen for it.<br/>It is light and flexible, thus making it suitable for a ninja.<br/>Sayu is especially fond of the huge hood, as it brings about a sense of security.<br/>The long tail is designed for Sayu to maintain balance on the branches.<br/>As for the only drawback... this outfit probably looks too much like a tanuki, and Sayu often gets misunderstood because of it.<br/>Initially, she would seriously explain to the other party that:<br/>\\\"I'm not a tanuki, I'm Sayu.\\\"<br/>However, over time, similar incidents have occurred too many times, and Sayu now bears a grudge against tanuki.<br/>Nowadays, if such a situation happens again, Sayu will pout in anger.<br/>So, in order to get along well with Sayu, please memorize the following:<br/>Sayu is not a tanuki, but Sayu.<br/>Her outfit is also not that of a tanuki's, but a mini mujina.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"This is the story of Sayu when she just started being on her own.<br/>Fragile beings walking alone in this world inevitably find themselves in scary situations. The only way to understand what it's like is to have experienced it.<br/>This is exactly what happened to Sayu. Adept at observation and evasion, she has always understood that she is not suitable for combat.<br/>Her overly petite stature gives her no advantage in terms of strength to speak of, and her ninjutsu will not be of much use in actual combat.<br/>Yet missions do not wait for ninjas to grow fully before descending upon them. In an era of turmoil, Sayu would also find herself in trouble because of not-so-important work.<br/>Surrounded by strong foes, she had to do her best and barely managed to escape. It cost her almost everything to bring the information back safely.<br/>Exhausted and wounded, Sayu was about to faint, but only one thing lingered in her mind:<br/>\\\"It's not only strong brute force that can overpower everything, the weak have their own way of surviving. It's because you're weak that you can notice those unseen moments that change your fate... The chances of escaping from here are slim, but that's what my ninjutsu is for.\\\"<br/>The moment the leaves fell, she disappeared. All her pursuers were incredulous. The tiny ninja disappeared as if she were dust in the wind.<br/>The next morning, Sayu struggled to get up, and found that the ninja pack strapped to her leg had long since disappeared.<br/>However, a surprising object appeared in the same place instead — a Vision gleaming in the sunrise.<br/>Now, with the power of the Vision, Sayu can wield a claymore taller than herself. She no longer has to fear the omnipresent strife of a chaotic world.<br/>Unfortunately, Sayu's most immediate worries have not yet been resolved.<br/>Regarding her growing taller, it seems that even a Vision is unable to do anything about it.\"}]}\n",

Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?<br/>Even Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.<br/>Who knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"The Crux, an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.<br/>The sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.<br/>Beidou had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, \\\"This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now.\\\"<br/>The sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.<br/>Still, their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.<br/>\\\"I've heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?\\\"<br/>\\\"...\\\"<br/>Kazuha would remain silent in the face of all such queries.<br/>Over time, after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.<br/>Eventually, it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.<br/>\\\"Hey, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?\\\"<br/>The young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.<br/>\\\"My name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Kazuha was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.<br/>Inazuma City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.<br/>As the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.<br/>He had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.<br/>To Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.<br/>When the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.<br/>These are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?<br/>Thus did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"All travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.<br/>After leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.<br/>All that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.<br/>It was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.<br/>The traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: \\\"Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!\\\"<br/>But Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: \\\"If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away.\\\"<br/>But the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.<br/>Upon knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.<br/>Perhaps it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.<br/>When he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha stood nearby, looking down at him and smiling.<br/>Before the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.<br/>Kazuha smiled and said: \\\"The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Kazuha made many friends during his travels. One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.<br/>But they too would part, for their destinations were different.<br/>To have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.<br/>But something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.<br/>All who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.<br/>It was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a \\\"duel before the throne,\\\" and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.<br/>The defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.<br/>And yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.<br/>Even the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.<br/>His friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.<br/>From that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.<br/>Kazuha did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.<br/>He did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...<br/>\\\"Is this endless conflict truly the only way to assert one's ideals?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The Crux Fleet became Kazuha's new home, and he drifted on the ocean wherever it took him.<br/>Trouble still found him from time to time, but no issue was insurmountable with the support of the Crux crew.<br/>From his vantage point on the Alcor's crow's nest, gazing out at the azure sea and sky, he finally had the space to think over the tumultuous events of his past and what it all meant to him.<br/>\\\"Every samurai wishes to live their life with passion and to claim the greatest reputation possible using the sword in their hands.\\\"<br/>\\\"But there will always be those whose base desires lead them astray from the path of justice and virtue, and whose blades leave an endless trail of enmity in their wake.\\\"<br/>\\\"Surely the heavens did not give us fleshly forms and the gods did not watch over our lives all so that we might take up arms against one another.\\\"<br/>\\\"Then, this sword I wield is not meant to slay, but to save...\\\"<br/>\\\"Yes, this shall be my path as a samurai, and I shall defend it all my days.\\\"<br/>As he reached the conclusion of his thoughts, Kazuha was suddenly inspired to pen down a few verses to serve as a maxim for himself thereafter... but before he could get started, he was interrupted by an irate voice from down below:<br/>\\\"Hey, Kazuha, quit gawking at the sky — get down here and lend a hand!\\\"<br/>It seemed the maxim would have to wait for another day. Whatever the helmsman, Sea Drake, needed help with clearly couldn't wait.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision Shell\",\"desc\":\"Kazuha was just as surprised as everybody else when the Vision briefly lit up during that great battle.<br/>For in all the time that he had spent searching high and low trying to find someone who might rekindle it, never had he imagined that he could be the one to cause its light to shine once more. It was almost as if his late friend were lending him his aid from behind the scenes.<br/>This empty shell of a Vision not only proved this, but had also brought him many fateful encounters along the way:<br/>He had been aided by the resistance, saved and taken in by Captain Beidou, and he had even met the fabled Traveler...<br/>In life there were seasons of hopelessness and desperation, but there were also moments of great serendipity.<br/>His journey was like the rise and fall of a mountain path — at times, the struggle was all but too much to bear, but there would always be moments when he would touch the clouds.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"The morning mist covered the mountains like a blanket as Kazuha trod a small trail alone.<br/>The world was silent. Not a single feather flapped, and not a single cicada sang.<br/>Even the roiling waves seemed to have fallen into slumber, leaving just the faint whisper of the wind audible against the silence. Kazuha stuck out his tongue — the air tasted heavy and gloomy.<br/>This told him that it would soon rain.<br/>He peered into the distance and spotted a plume of smoke up ahead. Below it were several straw huts. Tonight, it seemed, he would have a roof over his head.<br/>He informed the owner of the house that a storm was coming. At first, he was met with skepticism, but come noon the rains arrived right on cue.<br/>In awe of this wanderer's skill, the master of the house eagerly offered him lodging.<br/>The storm raged into the night. Kazuha held his quilt close, and as he listened to the onslaught of rain against the autumn leaves, his mind began to wander.<br/>In the time since the Kaedehara Clan's fortune had faded away and he had set off on his journey, Kazuha had traveled across many of Inazuma's islands and had become intimately acquainted with the plight of the wanderer.<br/>Moving between islands usually necessitated traveling by sea. Kazuha would make these trips alone, in a small, slow boat, making things all the more perilous when he had to battle against strong headwinds or violent thunderstorms...<br/>And yet, there was limitless fascination to be found in this same journey of his, where the vast sky and boundless earth was his home, and all living things that inhabited them were his friends.<br/>If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty.<br/>But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure.<br/>With his sword in his hand and his chosen path in his heart, he could go on his way with a song on his lips and with nothing to fear, no matter the perils he may face.<br/>Kazuha slept soundly that night, his mind at rest having made peace with his feelings.<br/>The next day, he awoke to the sound of birds... and a shining Vision lying upon his chest.\"}]}\n",

He sometimes sings outdated songs, other times he hums new ones that none have ever heard of.<br/>He likes apples and lively atmospheres, but hates cheese and anything that is slimy.<br/>When channeling Anemo, it appears in the form of feathers, because he likes things that look light.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Back when traveling bard Venti had only been in Mondstadt for a few months, his income was far less than the other more established bards in town. But once he had a few Mora in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time — one of the city's taverns.<br/>Unfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.<br/>The first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: \\\"I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here...\\\" Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...<br/>The strategy he developed was drinking on the job — that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.<br/>The novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.<br/>There was just one snag — he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...<br/>And if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.<br/>Venti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.<br/>Easier said than done — the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"There is a towering oak tree at the center of Windrise, said to have sprouted when Vennessa ascended to the heavens a millennium ago.<br/>In the past few months, travelers resting in the shade of the great oak sometimes hear a young boy singing the tales of Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.<br/>Unlike the ruling deities of the other nations, Barbatos has long left Mondstadt. In fact, the only visible proof of his connection with Mondstadt is the Statues of The Seven that appear across the land — even then, the resemblance is vague at best. Fortunately, Barbatos's past deeds are recorded in books and epics, sung and passed on by the bards.<br/>In contrast to these more canonical works, Venti's ballads tend to include bizarre adventures and acts of mischief, such as the time that Barbatos pinched the Cryo Archon's scepter and replaced it with a hilichurl's wooden club...<br/>Worshippers of Barbatos are quick to decry these frivolous tales as blasphemous fabrications. But whenever someone confronts Venti about this, his response suggests that he has not an ounce of remorse.<br/>\\\"How can you know that they're fabrications?\\\"<br/>He has a point — even the most devoted sister could not possibly know the details of all of Barbatos's deeds from a millennium ago.<br/>Only Venti knows the truth behind his song lyrics, and it is a truth he hides behind an enigmatic smile.<br/>Reason being, yes — Venti's tall tales of Barbatos's unorthodox exploits are entirely fabricated.<br/>Hey, Venti finds that a few drinks really gets his muse going. Can you really blame him?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Around 2,600 years ago, the Archon War had yet to end, and the world had yet to fall under the dominion of The Seven.<br/>In those days, the city called \\\"Mondstadt\\\" was surrounded on all sides by gales impenetrable even to the birds of the air. The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.<br/>The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was Decarabian, God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.<br/>In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.<br/>He who would in latter days be known as \\\"Barbatos\\\" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.<br/>In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a young boy. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.<br/>\\\"I do so wish to see the birds in flight.\\\"<br/>So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.<br/>\\\"Friend, will you not come along?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"The elemental being Venti obtained the feather of an eagle for the lad living in that storm-shrouded city, who had never seen a bird in his life.<br/>Then, war broke out in Mondstadt, in the name of freedom.<br/>With the feather tucked away in his breast pocket, Venti watched the fall of the eccentric ruler amid the wrack and ruin of revolt together with his friend.<br/>The ruler had believed that he had given his subjects a city free from the bitter cold, and to the end, he believed that they had loved him as he loved them.<br/>Yet, despite the victory, Venti was never able to give that feather to the lad, for that lad had fallen in the battle for the sake of song, sky, and birds, and for the people who, like him, had dwelled within the storm-wall.<br/>With the crumbling of an ancient seat of divinity, a new god was born. The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.<br/>His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.<br/>For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.<br/>Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.<br/>He bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.<br/>In future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.<br/>\\\"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place.\\\"<br/>Thus, a new age began for Mondstadt.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The Anemo Archon cannot take credit for everything in Mondstadt.<br/>Credit should be given where credit is due, I shall sing now the praises of things beauteous and true:<br/>We thank the West Wind, whose enduring caress<br/>Brings the blossoms of Spring, by whose scent we are blessed.<br/><br/>Finches, ducks, rabbits and boars,<br/>Mondstadt's revival bid them thrive evermore.<br/>In summer the lion walks the plains,<br/>No words one finds to praise it but these:<br/>Do you sweat out your water to make way for wine?<br/>Comes the heat of the summer from your mane of sunshine?<br/><br/>The mountain mouths and gorges low like drunkards wayward lie...<br/>But the East Wind cares not, for it doesn't walk — it flies!<br/>Over the fruit trees it brushes low,<br/>And its wings bring the harvest of things that grow.<br/><br/>The North Wind in the silent forest slumbers,<br/>And around it pace the wolves in their numbers.<br/>Though most have never a glimpse of them seen, for the Wind knows that none is of winter too keen,<br/>Yet the Anemo Archon glimpses and sees, that it dreams each night of warm reverie.<br/><br/>—As the four seasons in turn shall say their piece, so the four winds too shall never cease.<br/>Of course, to look at it differently, I am the one who should be credited here, and not they.<br/>Credits should be given where credits belong — if not for the bard who pens the song, then who shall ensure that these tales are passed on?\"},{\"title\":\"Where the Wind Doth Not Blow\",\"desc\":\"After 1,600 years of history, Mondstadt's \\\"freedom\\\" had sunk to a heretofore unseen low.<br/>Barbatos, unwilling to become a tyrant, had departed. But he had never imagined that those to whom he had gifted freedom would make for themselves a tyrant.<br/>The aristocracy ruled Mondstadt with a cruel hand, bringing slaves into this land and ignoring the cries of the oppressed.<br/>Thus the Anemo Archon returned after these 1,600 years to what was once the City of Freedom. He heard the cry of the slave girl Vennessa, and together with her raised a rebellion that overthrew the aristocracy.<br/>—Now, the above is what all know to be the official history of Mondstadt.<br/>The story has an interesting, little-known twist, however.<br/>The one who united the people of Mondstadt in this conflict was indeed the hero Vennessa — but that which caused many of the aristocracy's troops to turn coat was a \\\"treachery against the wind.\\\"<br/>A secret treaty was found, a betrayal of the city — the aristocrats had forsaken the wind, and sold everything in Mondstadt to the Geo Archon of the neighboring land.<br/>At the treaty's end was carved an insignia inimitable by all save the deity so named: Rex Lapis.<br/>How the soldiers that had once oppressed the slaves shuddered when they saw that they too would become slaves in a foreign land.<br/>The news, and the conflict, spread like wildfire, consuming the aristocracy. It was only many years later that historians would discover that this treaty was fake.<br/>As it turned out, Venti had once practiced the art of forgery in order to play pranks on the Geo Archon, but could never deceive the god of wealth and transactions. Even so, his adeptness would come into play after several hundred years.<br/>What a happy coincidence.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"The Seven Archons do not need Visions, for they already have great power.<br/>Yet Barbatos was fond of the mortal world, and wanted to roam Mondstadt more freely as \\\"Venti.\\\" As such, he constructed a glass ornament very much like the Visions worn by those chosen by the gods.<br/>The imitation has no special abilities, nor does Venti rely on it to channel elemental power.<br/>However, since Venti does not keep the Holy Lyre der Himmel by his side, and since he is too lazy to bring a normal lyre, he gave his fake Vision the ability to turn into the wooden lyre \\\"Der Frühling.\\\"\"}]}\n",

The Tianquan, Ningguang, has written a very comprehensive compendium of laws to deal with this, but not everyone has the patience to study them.<br/>Thus was born the role of the legal adviser in Liyue society. Highly familiar with Liyue's laws, they help those in need to navigate any contradictions, earning recompense for their efforts.<br/>Yanfei is the premier legal adviser in Liyue Harbor.<br/>She is always able to obtain the most benefits for her clients, insofar as the law will allow. Some even call her \\\"the law that walks.\\\"<br/>But in truth, what Yanfei — one of the few half-illuminated-beasts who have yet to sign a contract with Rex Lapis — really wants to do is live a free and happy life.<br/>As for the copy of \\\"The General Law of Liyue\\\" that she carries around on her person, Yanfei has this to say:<br/>\\\"If you don't wish to be bound by the rules, you have to first understand them all.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"As the most sought-after legal adviser in Liyue Harbor, Yanfei's rates are also top-of-the-line.<br/>Even so, she never lacks for people coming to seek appointments. After all, merchants are not stingy about mediation fees, but are very picky indeed about the mediator.<br/>\\\"Money is no object — we must have Yanfei come and settle this matter for us.\\\"<br/>Many rate Yanfei in this fashion, not only for her quick-thinking or her masterful oratory, but also because she very greatly emphasizes the cornerstone of the law — \\\"fairness.\\\"<br/>Her mediations often end in win-win situations, and even merchants with daggers drawn will temporarily set their prejudices aside.<br/>Though she is unbound by a contract, Yanfei has made her own contribution to the peace and prosperity of Liyue.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"As a legal adviser, Yanfei does have her fair share of weaknesses. An example is the mediation of civil disputes that involve emotions and relationships.<br/>Divorces, inheritances, custody disputes, senior care, severances... The list continues.<br/>It is said that upright officials are hapless in household affairs, and so it also is with Yanfei, who grew up surrounded by love — these matters fall right into her blind corner.<br/>Sometimes, she will find that both sides have reason on their side, and other times she will find them to both be unreasonable. Child custody disputes are the absolute worst, as no matter how she settles them, the settlement will have a great psychological impact on the innocent children. Even if Yanfei chooses to soldier on, she will only tire herself out.<br/>\\\"Hopefully, everyone can meet the right person and be spared this particular grief.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"As a result of her greatly tolerant nature, Yanfei has a wide variety of personal relationships throughout Liyue.<br/>There is no need to worry about rubbing a sore spot, and you'll be able to get along with her whether you're an avid conversationalist or not.<br/>Of course, this is true as long as you don't attempt to debate with her or start a conversation about the legal profession... Yanfei in work mode is a completely different beast to deal with.<br/>Additionally, Yanfei has cultivated the habit of being overly rigorous from her long years of studying the law. When chatting, Yanfei will vigorously eliminate any ambiguity or loopholes present in the discourse and can seem like a bit of a chatterbox. When she realizes this, Yanfei is wont to knock herself on the head with a book in irritation.<br/>However, so long as she constantly bathes in a sea of legal literature, this habit will probably be quite hard to break.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"When investigating the law, Yanfei's habit is to look past the cold letters of the law to perceive their point of origin.<br/>As such, she is also something of a master of \\\"reading comprehension\\\" in her relationships.<br/>Once, the Traveler met Yanfei by chance and said, \\\"Huh. Didn't expect to see you here.\\\"<br/>This should have been a line that one might hear just about anywhere, but it wound up holding a completely different meaning for Yanfei.<br/>\\\"Didn't expect to meet you here\\\" implied that the Traveler had at least thought about a scenario in which they would meet. Then why the use of \\\"didn't expect\\\"? One could only postulate that the Traveler had some expectation of where she might appear, and that her current location was not such a place. But whence came the expectation? Could it be that the Traveler had always been paying attention to her in secret?<br/>\\\"Does this mean that the Traveler...?\\\"<br/>Yanfei tossed and turned in bed that night, unable to sleep.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Yanfei's most prized possession is the steelyard balance that her father gave her.<br/>It is said that this balance was a treasure given by Rex Lapis that can be used to measure the value of all things. For convenience, Yanfei tends to use Mora to balance the scales, which is to say that she uses Mora to evaluate objects.<br/>The prices of many objects have slowly changed over the years, but weighing an object with this balance only gives its value at the time Mora was created, leaving the rest to Yanfei to exercise her own wisdom and judgment.<br/>Across the measurements of countless objects, Yanfei is able to see the changes in Liyue. Some objects that were once common have become vanishingly rare, and some exotic objects of the past have been rendered pedestrian today.<br/>This steelyard balance reminds her that many things cannot be valued by the standards of the world.<br/>Yanfei once tried to weigh the value of a Vision, but no matter how much Mora she added, the scales would not be balanced.<br/>In frustration, she placed on the scale the box at her waist, which contained her heavy, handwritten legal notations. Only then did the weights at last even out.\"},{\"title\":\"Codex Finalem\",\"desc\":\"This is the most special of the many legal treatises that Yanfei collects.<br/>As opposed to the codices that grow heavier and more complicated with time, this book is unbelievably light and thin.<br/>After opening it and getting past the prologue, one will find naught but the most basic few principles of the law inscribed.<br/>As Yanfei sees it, this is the final form of the law. In the far future, the law will have entered into the people's hearts. All people will be amiable, modest, and live happily in this world. The halls of judgment will lie empty and the mountains of legalese shall be caked in years of dust.<br/>Though this may sound like something very far off, for someone like Yanfei, in whom flows the blood of an illuminated beast, living till that day is hardly a great accomplishment.<br/>\\\"Hmm, but if I think about it more deeply, I'd be out of a job then, wouldn't I?\\\"<br/>After encountering one of Xinyan's performances by chance, Yanfei was quite taken by this new wave of performance art.<br/>That said, learning an instrument from scratch proved to be a bit difficult, so after consulting a great many resources, Yanfei came to what she considered to be a decent backup plan.<br/>If such a day were to arrive, she would just become a rapper.<br/>For someone who can recite tens of thousands of words' worth of Liyue law from front to back within an hour, speed at least should be no challenge.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Yanfei's father is an illuminated beast, while her mother is an ordinary mortal merchant. Born into peaceful times, Yanfei did not sign a contract with Rex Lapis, but instead has one with her parents to \\\"live happily.\\\"<br/>As Liyue's leading legal exegete, she is no stranger to exploiting some existing loopholes in the law — at times for herself, and sometimes for others.<br/>It has been made clear often enough that Yanfei is not a stickler for the rules and has no wish to be shackled by strictures.<br/>Still, she contributes to the betterment of Liyue as she seeks her own pleasure, and will not use these loopholes for ill.<br/>When making amendments to legal loopholes each year, Ningguang the Tianquan will often study Yanfei's doings, as if she were Liyue's unofficial legal troubleshooter.<br/>In a sense, one could argue that Yanfei makes the laws better at the lowest possible price... This principle is also the reason why she has never been convicted of exploiting any such loopholes.<br/>Yanfei believes in \\\"no structure without laws,\\\" and what she wishes for is to \\\"live as one pleases without overstepping.\\\"<br/>Everyone in Liyue, adeptus or mortal, protects it in their own way.<br/>That is why Yanfei possesses a Vision, one that is of equal weight to her principles.\"}]}\n",

Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Balance\",\"desc\":\"This steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.<br/>So, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: The Rule of Law\",\"desc\":\"I have a self-defense method that I call \\\"Wrath of the Flame,\\\" based on a punishment called the \\\"Wrath of the Rock,\\\" which is detailed in the ancient work \\\"The Comprehensive Compendium of Liyue Law.\\\" The Lord of Geo is the God of Contracts, and contracts, too, can be seen as a way of restraining people. Haha, ergo, Liyue Harbor has been the City of Contracts since time immemorial.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"The Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that \\\"The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset.\\\" Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes.\"},{\"title\":\"About Qiqi\",\"desc\":\"I heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on! She's definitely destined for greatness...<br/>\\\"The young of today shall outperform us tomorrow,\\\" as they say. I must admit, she has my respect.\"},{\"title\":\"About Ganyu\",\"desc\":\"Ganyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xingqiu\",\"desc\":\"The Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton.\"},{\"title\":\"About Hu Tao\",\"desc\":\"I always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business. They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work — there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.<br/>If I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph...\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli\",\"desc\":\"Mr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.<br/>And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then — if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself...\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...<br/>Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity...\"},{\"title\":\"About Keqing\",\"desc\":\"The Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.\"},{\"title\":\"About Eula\",\"desc\":\"Eula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yelan\",\"desc\":\"Yelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is... I feel like she's able to read my mind at any given moment when talking to her... Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kuki Shinobu\",\"desc\":\"Shinobu? I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yanfei: I\",\"desc\":\"A client? Very pleased to meet you, here's my card. I'm afraid I can't leave my desk today, if it's a dispute we're dealing with then please bring the relevant parties here to see me. Let me just give you a breakdown of my fees — one moment...<br/>Huh? You came just to chat? Uh... no fee necessary then. So just to clarify... you came to chat as friends with a legal expert that you've never met before... care to explain?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yanfei: II\",\"desc\":\"These antlers? Oh... well my father is an adeptus, so I have adeptus blood myself. Still, I was born during peacetime here in Liyue — I never signed a contract with Rex Lapis. Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs — I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yanfei: III\",\"desc\":\"Contracts of that magnitude — lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose. That's the kind of person he is. I'm proud of him for that. If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yanfei: IV\",\"desc\":\"Sometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!<br/>Think about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Yanfei: V\",\"desc\":\"Most of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.<br/>For me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.<br/>In any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin.\"},{\"title\":\"Yanfei's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My hobbies are reading and appraisal. Reading begets knowledge, appraisal improves judgment. As such, I read everything and appraise anything. If you don't believe me, bring something over sometime. If there's a market for it, my estimate won't be far off. Take this stone for example... must be... 600 Mora.\"},{\"title\":\"Yanfei's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"My friends from the Communications Office often get me to go fishing with them. They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face — are you doubting me?\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Oh! On that note, let me recommend my one true love. Tofu — tofu all the way! Light in flavor, tender in texture, not to mention smooth and nourishing. It goes well with all manner of soups and dishes, and more importantly — it's available throughout the seasons! Beauty over complexity... tofu dishes are my kind of flavor.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I don't like cold dishes... maybe it's because I rarely eat them. When I would get home late, my father used to keep a lantern lit for me. He'd hear me coming and ask me if I was hungry. In his words: \\\"The best dishes are served hot.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy birthday! Here, this is for you. I've collated legislation from all the nations — you're planning to go traveling, right? It will serve you well to familiarize yourself with the law of the different lands.<br/>Don't study too hard mind you, or else... I won't be of any use to you.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Do not seek to emulate the past, for there is no law that can suffice for all time\\\"... This is a lesson I must always bear in mind.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Only by adhering to the law can the people solve life's myriad of problems.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Studying the law allows one to have grounded conversations, whilst learning martial arts allows one to prevail against groundless violence. Hey, wait a minute... does this count as martial arts...?\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"Well, I guess I've mastered both the pen and the sword! I've been lucky to have you with me through to the end of my training. Compensation? Uhh... a twenty-four-hour specialist personal advisor? Sounds good...

This will lives on in the bloodline of the Sangonomiya Clan, and follows them from generation to generation.<br/>The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess.<br/>The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a god in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"The day Kokomi ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, countless inhabitants of Watatsumi Island came to Sangonomiya Shrine of their own accord to see her.<br/>Surprise, suspicion, confusion, chuckles... Their expressions were strange, all on account of her overly-young appearance in their eyes.<br/>Plots were hatched and questions were endless. The ambitious planned to make their move. The storm was approaching, and all was not at peace on Watatsumi Island.<br/>Yet all went back to business as usual not long after Kokomi ascended to her position.<br/>She was fair in distributing rewards and punishments alike, appreciated the contributions of the people, and was militarily skilled. Her many abilities quickly won the hearts of most of the people.<br/>\\\"Things will be alright as long as Her Excellency is here\\\" soon became the most widespread saying on the island.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"There are many factors involved in deciding victory or defeat.<br/>Terrain, weather, differences in military strength and equipment quality... All of these require careful consideration.<br/>Those who study the details too closely tend to miss changes on the field, and most who speak of strategy speak of it in a vacuum.<br/>Only those who can grasp both the big picture and the small details can create miracles on the battlefield.<br/>And behind all this lies countless hours of hard work delving into the reasons behind one's failures.<br/>Few if any ever persevere to the end, but Kokomi was not only good at this but also possessed a unique tactical style.<br/>\\\"Manipulate the larger strategic situation to force the other side to give up, and to win wars with the least amount of cost possible.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Whether on the battlefield or off it, Kokomi tries to \\\"know thy enemy\\\" as much as possible.<br/>She tends to predict all possible scenarios beforehand and devise strategies to address them, which are then delivered as directives to those who enforce her will.<br/>This has given rise to the issue of some of these directives being rather thick and heavy, but this method has guaranteed the stable development of Watatsumi Island.<br/>Today, Watatsumi Island moves each day towards greater prosperity, and as more talented people have been appointed to office, the directives that Kokomi has to deliver have decreased.<br/>As far as she is concerned, that is something worth celebrating.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"When Kokomi has the time to spare, she will go on walks on Watatsumi Island alone.<br/>She often tries to avoid crowds, pacing slowly through the violet forests, sometimes sitting by the seaside and looking out into the distance.<br/>The sun and the moon rise over the sea, the stars shine in their skies, and the sound of the waves is pleasing to the ear, relaxing the soul.<br/>Sometimes she will even place a seashell on her head, only to put it back where she found it when she leaves.<br/>In her mind, perhaps some wandering crab will burrow its way inside and call this shell home.<br/>Sometimes, Kokomi will also go diving, enjoying the calm atmosphere by herself, her worries sinking into the ocean depths as schools of fish swim all around her.<br/>Kokomi treasures every sight there is to be seen on Watatsumi Island, and she remembers the name of every person.<br/>Sadly, while scenery remains, people's hearts are complex and changeable.<br/>Victory is simple enough to attain compared to the mammoth task of making sure that everyone lives happily.<br/>This dilemma has always troubled her.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Kokomi has been well-read since she was young, and has a particular love for military treatises.<br/>As such, Kokomi has a broad store of knowledge to be used in every field.<br/>But another result of her constantly being buried in such treatises of war and illustrated military texts is that Kokomi lacks skill in social interaction. She does not know when it started, but interacting with people eventually became tiresome to her.<br/>Having ascended to the role of Divine Priestess, Kokomi had no choice but to learn many things that she wasn't any good at before, whether it was dealing with people or performing duties that she had little interest in.<br/>However, forcing herself to do things she holds little love for is a serious drain on her energy reserves, leaving her feeling quite exhausted.<br/>As such, Kokomi set up an \\\"energy\\\" system of measurement for herself. When she does things she enjoys, her energy levels will increase, and the reverse is true when she trudges through unenjoyable slogs.<br/>When she runs out of this energy, Kokomi will temporarily put her duties as the Divine Priestess aside and resume being an ordinary homebody.<br/>Engrossing herself in the close reading of a book on military strategy, walling herself off from the rest of the world — thus does Kokomi reclaim a temporary respite from her busy existence.<br/>These moments are of utmost value to her.\"},{\"title\":\"Secret Notes\",\"desc\":\"\\\"As the ruler is, so shall the people be.\\\"<br/>This precept was something Kokomi heard from her mother a long time ago.<br/>The Divine Priestess' role is one of utmost importance to Watatsumi Island, and its people's eyes are always upon her every move.<br/>The things she loves will be in fashion, and the things she dislikes, the people will also distance themselves from.<br/>Kokomi, in truth, has no wish to affect the people's lives, and as such has rarely ever revealed much of her personal likes or dislikes.<br/>She treats all things with an egalitarian manner, and holds \\\"fairness of judgment\\\" and \\\"justice in dispensing rewards and punishment\\\" to be her guiding principles.<br/>However, these are not necessarily her true feelings, and so she prepared a book of secret notes for herself.<br/>Here, she records the fluctuations in both her energy levels and mood.<br/>When the night deepens and the world falls silent, Kokomi will open this book and write the day's experiences, whether they be joyous, sad, or frustrating.<br/>...Of course, this object is for her eyes only — and so it must remain.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"A leader with a strong will can lead those around them in a clear direction.<br/>However, Kokomi lacks such strong ideals. Instead, she respects the will of the people and wishes that they can each find their own way.<br/>Just as the vast ocean can accommodate countless souls and their individual desires, so does Kokomi wish her rule could be.<br/>When the Vision Hunt Decree came about, the resentment of the people turned into cries of revolt, and so Kokomi led them in raising the banner of resistance.<br/>And once the war was over, the hearts of the people turned towards peace and stability, and so did Kokomi direct her energies towards governance and economics.<br/>But what was the source of this toil? Was this the role of the Divine Priestess speaking? Or was this a product of her own sense of duty? Or perhaps... it was a bit of both?<br/>As the Divine Priestess, Kokomi naturally has her own Vision. And ever since the day she looked out at the sea outside Sangonomiya Shrine, her wish has never once changed—<br/>\\\"I wish to protect all of Watatsumi Island and allow its people to lead happy lives.\\\"\"}]}\n",

I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities — they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yae Miko\",\"desc\":\"I have also heard of Guuji Yae's great deeds. In all fairness, I hold her to be an outstanding shrine maiden, and she has performed her duties marvelously. I even heard that she holds responsibility where Yae Publishing House's light novels are concerned. An enigmatic individual to say the least...\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun\",\"desc\":\"Now that the Vision Hunt Decree is over, Watatsumi Island has once again returned to normal life. It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island. It is my hope that the Shogun will fulfill her promise and that we can live with the Shogunate in peace. However, if there comes a day when she once again casts aside the aspirations of the people, I can assure you that we won't sit by and watch.\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"Kazuha once came and bunked with the resistance for a time. If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou — they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shikanoin Heizou\",\"desc\":\"Initially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed \\\"detective\\\" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: I\",\"desc\":\"No matter how pressing the situation may become, I must remain composed. If I let the stress get to me, then what can I expect from others around me?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: II\",\"desc\":\"Legend has it that our ancestors lived in a palace in the depths of the ocean, and that the god, Orobashi, brought us to the surface. I've often wondered, wouldn't a palace like that be too dark? Every time I think about it, I start to really appreciate the light...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: III\",\"desc\":\"After you left, the soldiers of Swordfish II nominated a temporary captain, but everyone was hoping that you'd return. I could only tell them that you'd been tasked with an important solo mission. If you get the chance, you should go visit them, I'm sure they'd love to see you.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: IV\",\"desc\":\"A long time ago, I had no intention of becoming the Divine Priestess. My only goal was to study military strategy and become an adviser. That way, I could remain behind the scenes and lessen my overall burden. *sigh* Fate had other ideas in store... You can't defy that which flows in your veins.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: V\",\"desc\":\"After becoming the Divine Priestess, I gradually grew accustomed to this life. At the very least, I have the power to change something when it doesn't sit well with me. More importantly, this title allowed me to meet you, did it not?\"},{\"title\":\"Sangonomiya Kokomi's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Huh? What do I enjoy? Simple. I like to find a quiet place by myself and read books on strategy... Ahh, the whole day, without interruption. I'd be even happier if we looked over some of it together. One thing though... You'd have to sleep on the floor.\"},{\"title\":\"Sangonomiya Kokomi's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"To be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my \\\"Divine Priestess airs\\\" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs. The people of Watatsumi Island need a perfect leader, not some girl who likes to wile away her time at home.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I just love eating Bird Egg Sushi. The ingredients are easy to find, and it's simple to prepare... Ah... perfect for military life. Sitting down to eat Bird Egg Sushi in the midst of war might seem a bit extravagant, but in most cases, simple food like this brings great satisfaction to the soldiers.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Mm... If I had to say, I'm not fond of any sort of seafood. But please, keep this strictly confidential. The fishing industry is essential to Watatsumi Island, and if word were to get out that seafood wasn't my thing, I'm afraid morale would be gravely affected.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy birthday! So, what are your plans for the day? Oh, why don't we celebrate on Watatsumi Island? First, I'll take you out at daybreak to see the sunrise, then we can go diving during the heat of the day. In the evening, we can go for a stroll around Sangonomiya Shrine. If it rains, we'll find somewhere cozy to hide out with a few strategy books, and try to bake a cake together! In any case, no need to plan anything, the grand strategist has everything thought out for you!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Brute force is not my modus operandi. But becoming stronger isn't a bad thing.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"I'm just bubbling with energy... We'll make a formidable force in our next fight.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"The moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. It seems that as I go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"I often used to succumb to self-doubt. I would think to myself, \\\"Can a person like me really hold the title of Divine Priestess?\\\" Now, the thought hardly crosses my mind. When I'm with you, I seem to be able to cut straight through most problems.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Allow me!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Hold the line.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Rest and rebuild.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Covenant of the Deep.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Billowing surge!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Torrents, bring refuge!\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"Let's move out.\"},{\"title\":\"Deploying Wind Glider: I\",\"desc\":\"Breathtaking.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Provisions are vital.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"We should make the most of these supplies.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"Mm...

The culprit, Klee, was sent to the confinement room for seven days for mistaking the cave the adventurers were still exploring in for a giant rabbit hole and blowing it up.<br/>Heckler suffered from a severe bout of diarrhea for a week after joining the team. Although it turned out to be food poisoning, he insisted it was because of Bennett's bad luck.<br/>\\\"They'll be back! They're just... on leave. Please don't invalidate my team's registration with the Guild...\\\"<br/>Seeing Bennett beg and plead before her eyes, Katheryne sighed and decided to spare him the truth that his \\\"teammates\\\" had long jumped ship.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"There was once a predicament of incomparable despair.<br/>A predicament that had all but swallowed an old adventurer.<br/>The scorching flames scalded his skin, the deafening thunder almost ruptured his eardrums, and the hollering winds threatened to rip his soul from him.<br/>At the end of his hellish journey, what awaited him was... a baby.<br/>The old adventurer thought he was the first living thing to pass through this hell on earth. But how could he explain that which lay before him?<br/>In that moment, it hit him, and he believed it to be true.<br/>\\\"This baby must be... a child abandoned by the world itself.\\\"<br/>Though there were no mighty artifacts, jewelry, or gold, the old man's face did not seem disappointed in the slightest, for he regarded this baby, whose life hung by a mere thread, to be his treasure.<br/>\\\"This child is what I was meant to find on this journey,\\\" he thought as he took the baby into his arms.<br/>Even if what he was about to do opposed the will of the world itself, he was unafraid.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"The old adventurer died from severe injuries before being able to tell this story, leaving only the child he had saved.<br/>On his deathbed, he only managed four final words: \\\"will,\\\" \\\"adventure,\\\" and \\\"final treasure.\\\"<br/>Several single, childless, old adventurers in the Adventurers' Guild in Mondstadt raised the child as their own and named him Bennett.<br/>Being raised by the Guild, Bennett referred to everyone as \\\"Dad.\\\"<br/>\\\"Dad, your dentures fell into the bowl!\\\", \\\"Dad, you should stop wearing that old leather armor. Where are the undergarments I bought you?\\\", \\\"Dad, it's raining, better keep your distance from me so you don't get struck by lightning!\\\"<br/>Taking care of all his aging dads who have no family has taken up most of his time outside of adventuring.<br/>\\\"The dads certainly have found a treasure, haha!\\\"<br/>Cyrus, the current Guild Master, laughed, giving Bennett a pat on the back.<br/>Though he is unlucky himself, he can at least try to bring luck to those he cares about. At least, that's how Bennett feels.<br/>Bennett the Unlucky still strives to find his own lucky treasure through his series of unfortunate events.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Oz the Raven, Fischl's familiar, said Bennett is \\\"the most tenacious young man in the world.\\\"<br/>Indeed, Bennett's share of bad luck throughout his life can be seen from his scars, old and new.<br/>Attacked by monsters, buried in collapsed ruins, falling from cliffs... A wealth of \\\"unfortunate events\\\" has taught Bennett how to deal with more of them in the future.<br/>Barbara, the Deaconess at the Church of Favonius, was once surprised by how skilled Bennett is at treating dislocated joints.<br/>Another gift from his ordeals is his jaw-dropping talent for combat.<br/>\\\"Look at his moves... Doesn't that hurt?\\\" Grand Master Varka of the Knights was extremely intrigued after seeing Bennett in combat.<br/>It's not that Bennett doesn't feel pain — he has simply gotten used to it. He adapted to the pain as others would to pungent smells or blinding light.<br/>Therefore, the way Bennett dives into battles head-on without reservation has become something of a signature of his.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"What does death mean, exactly? Always walking the thin line between life and death, Bennett can't help but wonder.<br/>Bennett knows that the old adventurer who saved him has left many praiseworthy stories and legends after his death.<br/>He knows that an adventurer will not have weeping at their funerals, only toasts made in their names by old comrades.<br/>He knows, to the adventurers of Mondstadt, a \\\"good death\\\" comes at the end of a life given to the pursuit of treasure and the secrets of the world. Once over, their souls are brought back to their homeland by Barbatos.<br/>He once feared death.<br/>However, after pondering on this matter some more, he now feels death may be something fortunate for an adventurer...<br/>Not that fortune has anything to do with him.<br/>\\\"Onto the next treasure!\\\" And with that, Bennett puts this thinking business behind him.\"},{\"title\":\"Adhesive Bandage\",\"desc\":\"Whenever he suffers severe injuries such as fractures or excessive loss of blood, Bennett will go to the Cathedral to seek treatment from Deaconess Barbara.<br/>\\\"Sorry, it's me again...\\\" Bennett will say, scratching the back of his head.<br/>Barbara, however, will just shake her head, and with a \\\"let's deal with those scratches as well,\\\" she will toss him some adhesive bandages.<br/>Such displays of concern may be inadvertent, but they have a special place in Bennett's heart. He sticks those bandages on his wounds with the care of one pinning a medal to their chest, before thanking her wholeheartedly.<br/>Bennett keeps many such bandages in his utility pouch when he goes on adventures. Ones he gets from his dads, from Barbara, from Katheryne... and from adventurers he sometimes meets by chance after getting injured.<br/>These tiny tokens of goodwill form a tangible collection of fair fortune unique to Bennett.<br/>\\\"Well, since everyone's by my side, I guess I'm not that unlucky after all.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Bennett's passion for adventure is unstoppable.<br/>He wants to constantly explore, challenge, sweat it out, and eventually grow old on the adventurer's path.<br/>But there was once when he met with a true crisis.<br/>Just as that old adventurer had so long ago, Bennett was in a predicament that would cause any other person to despair.<br/>\\\"Losing this much blood... Not good.\\\"<br/>But Bennett did not stop. \\\"There's no reason to turn back,\\\" he thought.<br/>Somehow, he just knew that all the agonizing misfortune he had suffered up till this point was for the sake of overcoming this precarious position.<br/>But at the end of his hellish journey, what he found at the end was — nothing at all.<br/>\\\"Ha, returning empty-handed is... part of an adventure. I... don't mind...\\\"<br/>At last, his tightly-wound emotions came loose, allowing his many injuries to rob him of his consciousness, and he collapsed.<br/>When he reawakened, he found that his wounds had been cauterized by a mysterious flame, stopping both the bleeding and the pain.<br/>A jewel pulsed warmly in the palm of his hand, its rhythm in time with the heartbeat in his chest — the beating heart of an adventurer.<br/>This was not the mercy of the world, or that fate took pity on him. Rather, this was his \\\"final reward,\\\" one befitting a person with Bennett's burning passion.\"}]}\n",

I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety.

The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?\"},{\"title\":\"About Varka\",\"desc\":\"He's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master!

Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?\"},{\"title\":\"About Noelle\",\"desc\":\"Noelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking.

It's a miracle if you ask me.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Bennett: III\",\"desc\":\"You've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now.

Do you feel the same way?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Bennett: IV\",\"desc\":\"I was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it.

Jean was raised by her mother to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.<br/>She was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: \\\"For Mondstadt, as always.\\\"<br/>Some time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say \\\"For Mondstadt, as always\\\" before learning to say \\\"Mommy.\\\"<br/>As a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, \\\"Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection,\\\" and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.<br/>Now, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.<br/>\\\"You have to give your all to do the right thing. Always.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Master Jean is so reliable.\\\"<br/>\\\"If you ever run into trouble, seek Jean. She'll know what to do.\\\"<br/>The denizens of Mondstadt, civilians and knights alike, all rely on Jean.<br/>If someone needs help for the right reasons, Jean does not hesitate to render assistance.<br/>Be it a quarrel down at the market, a relationship issue...<br/>No matter how unrelated it may be to a knight's job... Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.<br/>\\\"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight.\\\"<br/>To her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.<br/>She holds her fellow knights to the same standard.<br/>Lisa the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and \\\"enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady.\\\"<br/>However, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.<br/>\\\"Jean is so reliable.\\\"<br/>Such is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.<br/>Her only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.<br/>The dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Given everything Jean has brought to her role as Acting Grand Master, people sometimes forget that there is, in fact, a Grand Master who is her superior.<br/>This does not bother her in any way, though. Her role and title within the Knights of Favonius do not affect her work ethic in the slightest.<br/>Her passion, honesty, and meticulousness come from two things.<br/>One is her education and training, which instilled in her a chivalrous spirit from a young age.<br/>The other is the devoted teachings of Varka, the free-spirited Knight of Boreas and Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius, currently dispatched on a crusade.<br/>The effect the relaxed and unruly Knight of Boreas Varka has had on Jean's growth has been great.<br/>\\\"Grand Master, please take your job seriously. All of Mondstadt looks up to you.\\\"<br/>\\\"Well, you are my second-in-command, so helping me out is part of your job description. This way, I can focus on the really important things, wouldn't you agree?\\\"<br/>\\\"...\\\"<br/>He is the knight of new frontiers and legendary conquests, while she is the knight of maintaining peace and freedom.<br/>Jean does not resent Varka; perhaps there is wisdom in his conduct. However, what Varka leaves undone falls on her shoulders, and it is then down to her to do the right thing.<br/>Half a year ago, Varka led the elite knights of Favonius on yet another expedition away from Mondstadt.<br/>An expedition — how typical of Varka's character.<br/>\\\"I'll leave things here to you. I mean, you've basically been doing my job for years now, anyway.\\\"<br/>\\\"Leave it to me, Grand Master.\\\"<br/>After seeing the Grand Master off, Jean sat by the window and thought to herself:<br/>Upon your return, I will show you a kinder, more prosperous, and more peaceful Mondstadt.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"The great tree at Windrise is where the first Dandelion Knight came to the end of her journey.<br/>She was Vennessa, the founder of the Knights of Favonius and the restorer of Mondstadt.<br/>She bade farewell to the city she had vowed to protect, leaving behind her legend and a single sapling.<br/>After centuries of basking in the bliss of the thousand winds, this sapling grew into a towering tree.<br/>Jean was conferred the title of \\\"Dandelion Knight\\\" at the age of fifteen.<br/>The Dandelion Knight is also known as Lionfang Knight. Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.<br/>On the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.<br/>The title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?<br/>More than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?<br/>Beneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.<br/>The wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:<br/>For Mondstadt, as always.<br/>To become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.<br/>To this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more. It carries away her fatigue, so that she may once more have the strength to carry on.<br/>The great tree at Windrise marked the end of the first Lionfang Knight's journey.<br/>So too does it symbolize the beginning of Jean's.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Master Jean has a secret.<br/>The Gunnhildr Clan is a venerable knightly house. This prideful blood comes from Jean's mother, Frederica.<br/>Jean's father on the other hand is Seamus Pegg, an adventurer famed throughout the continent. When he came to Mondstadt, he dusted off his past self and started anew with the Church of Favonius, and ascended to high office within it, becoming known as the Cardinal of Daybreak.<br/>The two lovers eventually parted ways. Young Jean, holding her mother's hand, would watch the silhouettes of her father and her sister, Barbara, grow ever more distant.<br/>Later, Barbara would follow in her father's footsteps and join the Church of Favonius, becoming a deaconess much beloved by the people.<br/>Jean has always wanted to get closer to her younger sister by blood, but cannot bring herself to say anything when faced with Barbara's evasive eyes.<br/>Perhaps this all-too-similar awkwardness is a sign that the sentiment is shared.<br/>Master Jean has yet another secret.<br/>No matter how many times she has read the historical classics, despite her title of Dandelion Knight, and though she has become the Acting Grand Master whom everyone relies on...<br/>Jean still loves romance novels.<br/>This is not for the years as a young girl that she missed amid her training and duties, or due to the rift that formed in her parents' marriage.<br/>Jean simply yearns for the mutual attraction spoken of in such stories, for those emotions as subtle and fragile as spider-silk.<br/>As a knight, she must put Mondstadt and the Knights of Favonius first.<br/>But...<br/>\\\"If I too could...\\\"<br/>In her office, deep at night, Jean once again finishes reading \\\"Vera's Melancholy.\\\"<br/>\\\"If I have the time, it should be fine to go to Cape Oath, just before daybreak... right?\\\"<br/>Lowering her head, Jean peeks out her window at the glittering stars above.\"},{\"title\":\"Jean's Daily Schedule - Ver. XVII\",\"desc\":\"This schedule is accurate down to the minute.<br/>From a morning run with Amber followed a breakfast trip with Lisa on the way, to doing her own laundry by hand and settling her own change of clothes at night — all things great and small pack Jean's schedule rather tightly.<br/>Every completed item is ticked off, while ones delayed due to external factors list the detailed whys and wherefores.<br/>Next to the item \\\"Mondstadt Public Facilities Review\\\" — delayed due to a bout of illness — is written the following \\\"completed at 3 am, end-of-month book purchase award is canceled.\\\"<br/>Jean sometimes thinks that inspiration for this schedule may have been the training program her mother drew up for her ten years ago.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"If one were to go by skill alone, Jean has long become one of the best swordsmen in Mondstadt.<br/>But in Jean's heart, she would rather be a shield that defends freedom and song than a sword that cuts through corruption and darkness.<br/>\\\"Protecting\\\" has always been a tougher task than \\\"destroying.\\\"<br/>Around the time when she was promoted from Captain of her squad to Master of the Knights, a huge challenge stood before her. From without, the Fatui exerted diplomatic pressure, and from within, there were traitors — comrades of the former Inspector. Regrouping and finding a way to break through was no easy task.<br/>But Jean was able to fend off the external pressure with one hand, and lead the Knights to smash the many plots of the Abyss Order with the other, re-establishing the authority of the Knights of Favonius.<br/>Jean will never forget the moment she received her Vision. At that moment, all seemed to grow quiet as she felt the breeze flow through her hand. The world seemed to fade away, save for the time-honored motto of the house of Gunnhildr:<br/>\\\"For Mondstadt, as always.\\\"\"}]}\n",

Under her gentle exterior, Ganyu is as persevering as stone itself. This was something that Rex Lapis, the leader of the adepti, noticed very early on. Thus when the Liyue Qixing first emerged ages ago, Ganyu was their secretary. Through the years and the changes in the Qixing's roster, Ganyu has remained by their side as a constant. This has also meant that the mountainous piles of paperwork from the various departments and bureaus in Liyue have fallen upon Ganyu's shoulders. But though her workload has increased seven, a hundred, or even a thousandfold, her sense of responsibility has never wavered. Someone once queried as to the source of her motivation and received an answer that was not quite congruous with the question. \\\"What I've done... is nothing compared to what Rex Lapis has accomplished.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"I work for the well-being of all living things in Liyue.\\\"<br/>Under almost all circumstances, Ganyu is a very trustworthy secretary.<br/>It is hard to imagine anyone outperforming her in the face of such an enormous workload, especially given her unique and penetrating insights into all of Liyue's matters.<br/>Nevertheless, her reliability can only be guaranteed under \\\"almost all circumstances.\\\"<br/>The more important the matter, the more Ganyu strives for perfection, and the more nervous she becomes. Under pressure, her nervousness does result in the occasional error.<br/>One such incident occurred during the Rite of Descension, without doubt the most important annual event in Liyue's calendar.<br/>Ganyu was three minutes late for the Rite and had to squeeze through the crowd in full view of all.<br/>Later on, with a face as red as a tomato, she stammered her way through an unconvincing explanation, all the while apologizing profusely to Rex Lapis in her heart.<br/>Her colleagues guessed that there must be some reason for the mistake.<br/>Those who did not know her well saw that Rex Lapis did not mind, and thus paid the incident no attention.<br/>Those closer to her worried in private, and asked if she needed a workload adjustment or a short vacation, but Ganyu refused.<br/>\\\"I spent two hours making sure that I wasn't wearing anything too similar to last year's Rite...\\\"<br/>Needless to say, Ganyu was not about to admit to this being the real reason for her tardiness!\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"How long is a thousand years?<br/>Long enough for the Glaze Lilies that once teemed throughout Dihua Marsh to be wiped out by floodwaters, and long enough for the thriving settlement that sprung up upon Guili Plains to come to ruin in war.<br/>How short is a thousand years?<br/>To Ganyu, it has felt shorter than the blink of an eye.<br/>Throughout a passage of time unimaginable to mortals, Ganyu has been working on all manner of things at Yujing Terrace.<br/>She recorded the raising and demolishing of every building, and witnessed the rise to prosperity of every industry.<br/>Ganyu's sense of objectivity towards the passage of time comes from the endless reams of data she must trawl through, and from the ever-increasing number of colors she finds that she needs to categorize it all.<br/>All this time, her mindset has never changed — she constantly wavers between her human and adeptus halves.<br/>On one hand, Ganyu the qilin finds it difficult to comprehend mortal squabbles.<br/>But on the other hand, her human blood reminds her always to hold out hope that she might someday be able to fit in.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Outside the confines of her work, Ganyu very quickly shows how different she is from most other people.<br/>She has a habit of taking afternoon naps and has a shockingly accurate internal clock. When lunch hour arrives, no matter where she is, she will simply curl up into a ball and fall asleep on the spot. Even the raucous dancing of hilichurls will fail to wake her.<br/>These habits were at first just a running joke within the Liyue Qixing.<br/>But once, after accompanying the then-Tianxuan to lunch outside the city, a well-fed Ganyu simply crawled into the nearest roadside haystack. She ended up being transported all the way to Dihua Marsh, awakening only after bumping her head during the unloading.<br/>Unable to find Ganyu anywhere over the subsequent three hours, and knowing that she would not depart unannounced, the Tianxuan almost filed a missing person report.<br/>After receiving a stern admonishment to \\\"only take afternoon naps where it's safe,\\\" Ganyu retorted:<br/>\\\"Well... isn't everywhere in Liyue safe?\\\"<br/>Perhaps, with the mixture of human and illuminated beast blood flowing through her veins, Ganyu's understanding of the world's affairs is a little different to that of most humans.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Ganyu's qilin heritage is little-known in Liyue Harbor.<br/>Whenever she is asked by someone walking along Feiyun Slope as to the obvious protrusions in her hair, she says that they are ornamental heirlooms.<br/>\\\"If I told them the truth, they would distance themselves from me...\\\"<br/>Despite never having been on particularly close terms with Liyue's citizens in the first place, Ganyu would still not consider distancing to be a good thing.<br/>Her more important reason for hiding the truth is to prevent curious onlookers from touching her qilin horns.<br/>After all, a qilin's horns are a sensitive part of their body, both physically and mentally speaking.<br/>Another secret that Ganyu is anxious to keep hidden is the fact that she is watching her physique.<br/>The qilin are strict vegetarians, but Liyue is a veritable powerhouse of gastronomical delights, one in which even vegetarians struggle to control their appetites.<br/>Ganyu, who has grown accustomed to city life, is thus very vigilant in matters concerning her weight and physique.<br/>Whenever she finds herself being drawn towards some delicious dish, she will attempt to reassert her self-control. For Ganyu, the difficulty of such a challenge is second only to finding a Flaming Flower atop Dragonspine.<br/>But she is not one to give up half-way through the ascent.<br/>During the Archon War, she once choked a giant monster to death with ease after getting lodged in its throat when it tried to eat her, said monster having fatally underestimated quite how wide her waistline was.<br/>For Ganyu, avoiding any similarly embarrassing episodes in the future is an absolute must.\"},{\"title\":\"The Flora of Yujing Terrace\",\"desc\":\"Handwritten notes detail the morphological features and behaviors of the plants in Yujing Terrace, with each beautiful stroke penned by Ganyu's own hand.<br/>The notes are succinct, comprehensive, and well-categorized, and even offer some insights that one would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere on the market.<br/>These include pointers on caring for Glaze Lilies and methods for grafting Silk Flowers.<br/>In readability and scientific accessibility, they come close to the standard of official publications.<br/>Or rather, this is the experience if one starts reading from the front.<br/>Skip to near the end, however, and one may well be left dumbfounded.<br/>The final few pages are a shocking rash of black ink and frantically scribbled-out text.<br/>Reading patiently and painstakingly between the lines, one might just discover that these notes were, at one time, various methods for vegetable cultivation.<br/>\\\"But if I learn to grow vegetables, I'll be even less able to control my appetite.\\\"<br/>Her hands balling into fists, it was with much difficulty that Ganyu erased the results of her research.<br/>Later, whilst watering the plants on an empty stomach, Ganyu found herself plunging her head into a thicket of Silk Flowers, fantasizing that they were Sweet Flowers in an effort to comfort herself.<br/>Many more fantasy Sweet Flowers followed shortly afterward during her afternoon nap...\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Qilin are paragons of benevolence among the adepti, drinking only freshwater and eating only plants. Flies they will not hurt, and a bruised reed they will not break. They do not travel abroad, do not gather in herds, and no trap will hold them. They are leisurely yet composed, active but reserved — a gentle and elegant race. Yet when a wicked beast from the sea arose and threatened the land beneath their feet, that peaceful life ceased to be an option. Three thousand years ago, Ganyu answered the call of Morax the God of Geo, aiding him in the Archon Wars. And when the war was over, she chose to stay in Liyue and help the humans build a better polity there. The first Liyue Qixing would need support, and she took this task up as a matter of course, becoming their secretary. The moment she made that decision, a Vision appeared at her hip, granting her power to resonate with the world to a degree beyond her natural abilities. Whether she would grow strong enough to no longer need it, or whether she would use it as a last resort in Liyue's defense... Regardless, she chose to serve as the bridge between adepti and humans. Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.\"}]}\n",

The only reason I don't plant any at Yujing Terrace is because they taste so good that I worry I wouldn't be able to control myself... Huh? Bitter? Yes, they are... Isn't that what they're supposed to taste like?\"},{\"title\":\"About Morax: Trust\",\"desc\":\"I have absolute faith in Rex Lapis. It was only through his leadership that we were able to repel the monsters and subdue the sea creatures, and thus protect the peace of Liyue. The sight of him protecting the masses, and the memory of our centuries of camaraderie... I shall never forget it.\"},{\"title\":\"About Morax: Follower\",\"desc\":\"All of Rex Lapis' decisions prioritize the welfare of all life in Liyue. That's what I admire about him the most. I want to live up to the same standard... but it seems that the harder I try to follow in his footsteps, the more overwhelmed I get and the more mistakes I make...\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue. The current one, Ningguang, does it with unmatched efficiency, but that efficacious manner of hers draws a great deal of criticism. I suppose it is always simpler to criticize than to tolerate.\"},{\"title\":\"About Keqing: Estrangement\",\"desc\":\"I cannot stand her disrespectful attitude towards Rex Lapis! But he says to me, \\\"Ganyu, this is just the kind of person Liyue needs in this day and age.\\\" I guess I'm not smart enough, because I simply do not understand what he means by that. I think I need more life experience to become wise enough to comprehend his words.\"},{\"title\":\"About Keqing: Changing Perspective\",\"desc\":\"She came to me recently to discuss the reopening of the Bishui trade route. She even asked me what Rex Lapis would do if it were him. Admittedly, what we came up with was not quite on par with what he would have chosen. But... seeing the way she kept starting her plan from scratch over and over again, I think I started to understand her a little bit.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xingqiu\",\"desc\":\"You mean the boy in the blue jacket from the Feiyun Commerce Guild? He's nothing like his father and brother, doesn't seem to care about the textile business at all. Seems it's because as far as he's concerned, there are more important things for him to be doing. Of course, I'm merely speculating...\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiangling\",\"desc\":\"Xiangling is a celebrity! Um, but... I try to avoid her restaurant. Just... because. No reason. ...Okay, fine. It's not a big secret anyway. It's because you can smell her cooking all the way from the other end of the street. And once you get a whiff, I mean, that's it. You're gone. Next thing you know, you're ordering your second, maybe third round... You just can't control it. Even though I only eat the vegetarian dishes, I don't know what it is. But that is not a road I want to go down again... Not after...\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about The Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable, rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out...\"},{\"title\":\"About Yaoyao\",\"desc\":\"Yaoyao... Someone I know at the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked me with keeping an eye on her in the city, making sure she doesn't try and sneak aboard The Crux... Oh, you want to know what the Ministry of Civil Affairs does? ...Who knows, am I right!? Heh... Who knows what they do? ...Not me...\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiao\",\"desc\":\"He seems like a bit of an outsider, socially. Probably just his personality... I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us...\"},{\"title\":\"About Yanfei\",\"desc\":\"Ah, Yanfei... Even back when she was an innocent little girl, she would tell me that \\\"you have to keep your promises to live a happy life.\\\" Now, she's grown up to be a beautiful, graceful, and highly successful young woman.<br/>Although the work of a legal adviser is complicated, she always seems so carefree. This puts my mind at ease.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shenhe\",\"desc\":\"I actually don't know her all that well — I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite ferocious. Whenever her temper gets the better of her, she is likely to start obliterating her surroundings. I wonder if maybe she's just... bored. Should... Should I recommend some work to keep her occupied?\"},{\"title\":\"About Yelan\",\"desc\":\"Even though Ms. Yelan is absent from work for the majority of the year, I'm sure Lady Ningguang must have her reasons for making exceptions for her. Of course, it wouldn't be my place to ask, so I don't know the details of their arrangement. I remember seeing her one day on my way back to Yuehai Pavilion, she was having breakfast with a group of people — they were all talking and laughing, eating, drinking tea... I must admit, I found myself feeling a little envious in that moment.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Ganyu: I\",\"desc\":\"You have a last-minute job for me? Okay, uh... Sorry, please don't try and explain it all verbally... Write it down, leave a note here. I'll get to it as soon as possible.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Ganyu: II\",\"desc\":\"Let's see... \\\"I want to understand Ganyu better...\\\" Wh—What sort of request is that!? I've never done this before... Um, um, um... Okay... I can, ah... run you through my annual review from last year? That should bring you up to speed on me... No good? Oh, okay then...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Ganyu: III\",\"desc\":\"I've had a long, hard think, and I've realized that so long as it's for a work-related matter, there's really nothing for me to be embarrassed about. So if you really need to understand me more... This, uh, hairpiece... it's actually my horns. That's right. I'm part illuminated beast, qilin to be exact. Okay, so, now we've got that out the way... Please sign this non-disclosure agreement for me. And don't tell a soul.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Ganyu: IV\",\"desc\":\"Even though I'm part qilin, I'm still part human, too. Still, all these years I've been asking myself the same question: Do I really belong in the human world? Maybe I'm just like a Dendro Slime hiding in the earth, burying myself in numbers and reports in order to escape reality.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Ganyu: V\",\"desc\":\"Thank you for always making time to chat with me. I feel like I must have spoken more after meeting you than I have in the last ten years put together. If I keep going like this... Maybe one day I'll be able to move on to something other than secretarial work. Now that I've got a few hundred years of experience under my belt, I should be able to avoid any more major mistakes.\"},{\"title\":\"Ganyu's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My hobby... I would say... my job. What? Why don't jobs count as hobbies? I thought hobbies are supposed to be things you look forward to doing, and that make you feel good when you've done them. That describes my job perfectly. So what's the issue?\"},{\"title\":\"Ganyu's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"I don't understand why people insist on going all out to try and prove how their existence is more valuable than everyone else's. To exist in the first place is a beautiful thing, and that's enough... isn't it?\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Drink only spring water, eat only whole grains,\\\" that's my motto. So I would be grateful if you could please remove that treacherously enticing-looking plate of delicacies from my field of view. Much obliged!\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Qilins are strict vegetarians, so please do not take offense when I decline meat dishes. Yes, that includes your vegetable fritters since they have been fried in animal fat. Thanks, but I can't. I'm afraid I really can't. I don't mean to argue, it's just I have a keen sense of smell, so I know how they've been cooked.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Many happy returns! After all the times you've looked out for me, I didn't even remember to get you a gift — whoops! Silly me, I... What's that behind my back? Ah. You saw it then. It's a failed attempt at making a Qingxin flower cake... I wanted it to be perfect, but... Oh, you think it tastes good? Do you really?\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Power? ...Now there's a key performance indicator I haven't needed in a long time.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Could we maybe... find a peaceful resolution instead...? Never mind, doesn't matter...\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"I suppose this is the new way of life, then. I'm not going to complain. I'll try to embrace it.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"I remember reading in an ancient text that \\\"Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight.\\\" That's a massive exaggeration, but... should the time come for battle, and should you need me, then I will give it every ounce of my strength.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"No touching!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Access denied.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Born of ice and frost.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"All hail!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Glaze over!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"This is long overdue.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: IV\",\"desc\":\"For Rex Lapis!\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"We're way behind schedule...\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: II\",\"desc\":\"Next on the agenda...\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint End: I\",\"desc\":\"Healthy body, healthy mind...\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"There's nothing wrong with reaping a reward every now and then.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Beautiful treasures are a cause for great happiness.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"Perhaps whoever left these behind was... also fulfilling a contract?\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"I'm just way out of practice.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"Did I miscalculate?\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"I'm a little low on energy.\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"Rex Lapis...

I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations.\\\"<br/>\\\"If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured... Well, it was their decision to come here. There isn't much I can do about that.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Shenhe is in all likelihood the least accustomed to mortal life amongst those who take on an adeptal appearance.<br/>Having been sequestered in the mountains since a young age, she lacks experience and common sense, which makes it difficult for her to relate to people normally.<br/>To ordinary people, there are many solutions to any given problem. But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.<br/>For example, she almost never considers \\\"negotiation\\\" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to \\\"threats\\\" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?<br/>She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.<br/>For example: Why do we need to pay for food?<br/>Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?<br/>She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.<br/>In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.<br/>Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.<br/>Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:<br/>\\\"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character.\\\"<br/>\\\"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies.\\\"<br/>\\\"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Liyue has no lack of folktales about meetings with the adepti, and many of these concern relative nobodies whom an adeptus took under their wing, thus elevating them greatly.<br/>However, the circumstances under which Shenhe's fate became tied to the adeptal abodes was no such glorious thing. If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.<br/>When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.<br/>Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.<br/>He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.<br/>At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.<br/>Her father had brought with him a secret art known as \\\"Fate Transference\\\"—<br/>By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.<br/>At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.<br/>He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...<br/>But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.<br/>Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black \\\"seelie\\\" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.<br/>Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.<br/>Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.<br/>This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!<br/>Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark \\\"seelie,\\\" trembling yet resolute...<br/>Several days later, an adeptus following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.<br/>Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.<br/>If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Even the most diffident heart, cooled from living and training in the mountains for over a decade, might sometimes experience strange surges.<br/>So it was with Shenhe. On impulse, she came down from the mountains one night to return to what was once her home.<br/>She did not know how she felt about her home or her family. She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:<br/>To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.<br/>She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.<br/>Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.<br/>She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.<br/>She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.<br/>Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?<br/>They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant. It was as if her heart were an old well without ripples.<br/>No, like a barren well with no water upon which there might be ripples.<br/>She stood there for a long time, before departing again before the astonished eyes of all.<br/>Each step was slow indeed, but she never once turned back.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Liyue has its own fortune-telling, destiny-reading methods, similar to astrology.<br/>Of these, there are two fates that people seek to avoid at all costs.<br/>One is that of the \\\"solitary star,\\\" which dictates that one will be separated from friends and family, living alone all one's days.<br/>The other is \\\"disastrous evil,\\\" which means that one will face many hardships and perils.<br/>When the adepti rescued Shenhe, Moon Carver did once read her fortune.<br/>The signs showed that she was marked by both the \\\"solitary star\\\" and \\\"disastrous evil,\\\" and that she was also plagued by intense homicidal urges — she was thus a person of supremely ominous destiny, doomed to harm both herself and others.<br/>To ensure that she could grow up safely and not harm any innocents, the adepti bound her soul using red ropes.<br/>This binding had the effect of restraining both her evil fate and her violent tendencies, but also shackled many emotions that should have originally belonged to a human.<br/>From then on, she became more and more disaffected by trivial matters, and even things most might consider important were but dust to her.<br/>She became ever less human, and ever more like a lovely yet cold statue.<br/>But surprisingly, she felt something stir within her when she encountered that Traveler from a distant land:<br/>Long-dormant emotions, now strangers to her, came loose all at once from the depths of fate's tableau.<br/>Perhaps it really was as Moon Carver once said: that heaven might dictate fates, but destiny's tale is written by mortals. The tale of Shenhe and the mortal world had not yet ended...\"},{\"title\":\"White Jade Comb\",\"desc\":\"Once upon a time, Shenhe had a full head of black hair.<br/>When she was first brought to Mt. Hulao, she would not say a word. The only thing she proved willing to do was to climb the mountain and watch the sea of clouds.<br/>It was well, however, that she would sleep when tired, drink the dew of the mountains when thirsty, and would chew on a few stalks of Qingxin when hungry.<br/>Cloud Retainer took this all in, but did not disturb the girl, instead making this comb of white jade from a sacred stone and giving it to her.<br/>The adeptus said that if she ever wished to sever her ties with the mortal world and enter adeptal tutelage, she should brush her hair thrice with this comb, and it would be counted as a rite of apprenticeship.<br/>Shenhe did exactly as the adeptus said without any hesitation. And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.<br/>On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.<br/>When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.<br/>...<br/>Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.<br/>Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:<br/>The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Few people know how the young girl in the cave, intended as a sacrifice by her own father, had been able to stand against the monster for days and nights on end by herself.<br/>Though Shenhe was born into an exorcist family, her maddened father had not taught her a single thing about exorcism.<br/>And like many at that innocent age, she was also wholly unused to facing life's perils alone.<br/>But in that aphotic cave, bereft of parental protection — indeed, betrayed by kin — Shenhe underwent a metamorphosis.<br/>Just as Moon Carver's readings had shown, the sleeping calamitous fates, violent urges, and unyielding spirit within her burst their bonds all at once.<br/>Those things served as an unseen shield and invisible blade, arming the girl's frail form.<br/>They gave her strength, gave her claws and fangs, allowing her to attack that wretched creature before her, to swear to tear it to shreds — to prove that she, and not it, was the cruelest evil that stalked the darkness.<br/>Their life-and-death battle across the next few days was one without end. Hunter and hunted switched places many times, the conflict locked in stalemate...<br/>As the shadow of death loomed large, the gods looked upon the extraordinary girl with favor.<br/>With the bright, crystalline object falling into Shenhe's hands, the balance tipped irrevocably in her favor and the victor was decided.<br/>The vivid icy light pierced through the dark like skyglow, showing the path to the future.<br/>In the past, it had guided Shenhe from her miserable fate. In the future, it would also lead her back to the mortal realm.\"}]}\n",

After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I was abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Shenhe: V\",\"desc\":\"Once, I secretly left the mountain and returned to my childhood village without telling my master. But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you.\"},{\"title\":\"Shenhe's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on.\"},{\"title\":\"Shenhe's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... \\\"The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please\\\"... These are the exact words my master said.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"I've been told that birthdays are important occasions for most people. They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday... Hope you like it.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"The power I harness... It grows stronger.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"If my master were to learn about this, she'd probably have me add some more red ropes...\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"I haven't been training as single-mindedly lately, and yet it's as if I'm growing stronger and stronger without making a conscious effort... I'm left to assume the only way for me to achieve this is by your side.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"I once believed that freeing my mind from all agitation was the only way to overcome. But after everything I've experienced recently, I finally understand... Only when the right things weigh on your mind can the desire to protect awaken inside of you. And that turns your power into something... meaningful.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Obey!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Manifest!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Unleash!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: IV\",\"desc\":\"Transfiguration!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: V\",\"desc\":\"My will embodied!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: VI\",\"desc\":\"Take your true form!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"By ordinance divine!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Cryo incarnate!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Do your master's bidding!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"So this is what the world considers to be \\\"treasure\\\"?\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Adepti treasures have special powers...

						"data": "{\"list\":[{\"title\":\"Character Details\",\"desc\":\"Sucrose may be the assistant of the genius alchemist Albedo, but they could not be more different in research direction.<br/>As opposed to studying the essence of alchemy and the ability to create new life, she is far more interested in using alchemy to modify existing life, all the better to add variety and color to this world.<br/>Despite her youth, she has already achieved some brilliant results. For example, she has been able to increase the nectar output of Sweet Flowers by 70% by irrigating them with a special potion. She has also developed a special spray that allows Sunsettias to maintain their freshness for a whole month after being plucked from the branch.<br/>Even people who were initially suspicious of her research inclinations have come to acknowledge her exceptional talents in the field of alchemy after seeing such results.<br/>However, she merely considers these to be incidental steps on the path to a successful experiment, rather than the success itself. Her true aim is much more ambitious than this.<br/>It's a secret, and is also her little dream.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Bio-alchemy explores numerous lines of inquiry, all of which stem from Sucrose's questions about living things in the world. These questions, in turn, are born out of her insatiable curiosity, a faculty that is far more developed in her than it is in most.<br/>For instance, Sucrose's curiosity was once drawn to the sweet flower, accepted by most people as simply being a source of sugar.<br/>She wondered: Although sweetness is clearly the most readily identifiable feature of this plant, should that be grounds for limiting its application as we have tended to do? Does it not merit further study?<br/>So, after a careful study of the various features of sweet flowers, she devised thirty-something distinct rearing plans along with numerous control groups to account for temperature and other environmental conditions.<br/>And yet, her experiment still underestimated just how many variations were possible. After the experiment began, Sucrose found herself with more questions rather than fewer, and the novel discoveries that her experiment yielded gave her inspiration for further research.<br/>Sucrose is incapable of leaving a question unattended to — it makes her restless, even guilty, to ignore it. Spurred on by this quirk of her temperament, her rearing plans grew in number to almost three hundred.<br/>The result was a whole new series of sweet flower strains: Some with thrice the number of flowers, some with heads five or six times the normal size that could even float in the wind, and some even producing a sweet-tasting fruit.<br/>Months of experimentation later, Sucrose had finally answered every last one of her questions pertaining to sweet flowers. As she finished writing up her research notes, she let out a long sigh of relief.<br/>Though she was physically and mentally exhausted, the sight of stack after stack of her bio-alchemical research volumes stretching around three walls of the room gave her a deep sense of joy and satisfaction.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"To the people around her, Sucrose comes across as a quiet, introverted alchemist with little interest in the lives of others.<br/>In fact, the truth is quite the opposite: Sucrose is fascinated by absolutely everything that exists in the world. The only thing is, she finds the discipline of social interaction to be far more difficult to master than that of alchemy.<br/>In alchemy, the process of trial-and-error coupled with a determination to get to the truth is sufficient to bring you to your answer eventually. But with interpersonal relationships, there is the added complication of having to factor in manners, moods, and other unquantifiable variables. To make things worse, there seems to be no room for an approach that relies heavily on making errors.<br/>Hence, Sucrose decided to avoid such variables at all costs and stick to her familiar methods in satisfying her curiosity.<br/>For instance, Sucrose had always been curious about whether she and Cat's Tail bartender Diona, both of whom have animal ears, had any shared ancestry.<br/>In fact, this was not a private matter, and most people would simply ask the question. But Sucrose was concerned that it would be a sensitive topic — she, for one, did not like people drawing attention to her ears.<br/>So, she resorted to the method she knew best: observation.<br/>For one whole month, Diona constantly had an unnerving sense that someone was secretly watching her. She assumed that one of the tavern patrons was stalking her, and was none too happy about it.<br/>\\\"Similar genome, but ultimately different ancestry. Cat connection merits further study. Note: Unable to obtain bone sample thus far.\\\"<br/>This is the conclusion that Sucrose has jotted down in her notebook based on her findings so far.<br/>Bio-alchemy aside, Sucrose made one further discovery from this episode.<br/>That is to say, judging by the pair of cat-ear spectacles she made for herself after the event, it would appear that she has finally come to comprehend a certain uniquely feline variety of cuteness. She is too shy to wear them in public, however, and only puts them on when alone in her room.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Once every three days, Sucrose ventures out into the real world at dusk. To her, these excursions are rare and momentous events.<br/>One by one, she visits the butcher's, the Adventurers' Guild, and the Springvale hunters, looking for a material of a very specific kind.<br/>\\\"H—Hi... Sorry, I... I'd like, um, the freshest, best-quality b—bones you've got... Yep, the ones with the blood and meat still on.\\\"<br/>People found her behavior utterly unusual at first, but once they had gotten used to it, they were eager to oblige, even putting the rarest bones aside for her in advance.<br/>This was a major bonus for her. Not only was she able to acquire an ample supply of the usual chicken and boar bones, but she also got her hands on a complete lizard skeleton and even a chunk of hilichurl leg bone still bearing fresh blood.<br/>Her eyes would light up with excitement at the sight of these strange and rare bones. She would thank Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild profusely, bowing to her over and over.<br/>As well as going some way towards satisfying Sucrose's curiosity, she also found new inspiration from piecing new bones together<br/>More importantly, collecting skeletons was her hobby, and she was crazy about it.<br/>One day, Sucrose happened to overhear a mother attempting to discipline her child:<br/>\\\"If you don't do as your told, the scary old lady with the cloth sack over her back will come to your door, go into your room, pick out every bone from your body, and take them away!\\\"<br/>Sucrose's curiosity compelled her to investigate further. It turned out that this was nothing more than a ghost story used by mothers to shock their children into compliance, and that it had existed long before Sucrose was even born.<br/>She breathed a sigh of relief when she found out the truth.<br/>Soon after this, people noticed that Sucrose had switched her cloth sack for a leather one. Perhaps she did this just because she was shy. Or perhaps it was to avoid arousing suspicion...\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"As an assistant, Sucrose does everything she can to support Albedo, and even though his alchemical inquiries tend more towards the abstruse, she finds herself learning a lot every time.<br/>After an experiment lasting five straight days and nights came to its end, Albedo noticed that Sucrose was on the brink of collapsing from exhaustion, and organized a mandatory seven-day vacation for her.<br/>Sucrose began her holiday determined to take a proper rest and regain her energy, but from the moment that she woke up on day one she struggled to adjust to the vacation lifestyle.<br/>First things first, let's get some breakfast: fried eggs, sausages, and a cup of coffee. Nothing new to report there. All of these were foods and beverages that she had previously researched, after all.<br/>Next, she thought, how about a little rest and relaxation in the sun with a good book? Again, nothing new to report: plenty of research shows this to be one of the most effective means of relaxation. There wasn't a book that she hadn't already read, and there wasn't a query that she hadn't already highlighted, looked into, and later annotated for clarification.<br/>So then she did some household chores: laundry, dusting, tidying. Check. Once again — nothing new to report. There was nothing to dispute about the fact that a clean and tidy environment is conducive to mental well-being.<br/>Half a day in, and Sucrose had not had the occasion to ask \\\"why\\\" or \\\"how\\\" even once.<br/>She was bored, restless, and angsty, and she could not calm herself down.<br/>She was desperate to throw herself at a research problem. It didn't matter what it was: She would have happily researched the potted plants on the terrace, even if nothing came of it. Anything just to pass the time.<br/>But wherever she looked — the Lamp Grass to her left, the Sweet Flower in front of her, or the Cecilia to her right — all she found were things that she had previously researched in exhaustive detail.<br/>Finally, she gave up and forced herself to go to sleep. The next day, she reported to the laboratory first thing in the morning.<br/>\\\"All day long, you have nothing to research, and nothing to question. That's not rest, it's torture!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Sucrose's childhood was no different from anyone else's in Mondstadt. She had loving parents, she had her best friends. Life was simple, and beautiful.<br/>Her most enduring childhood memory is a story she once heard about a wonderful paradise.<br/>Somewhere in a far-flung corner of Teyvat, there was an undiscovered domain with pretty pink flowers the height of a hundred people, teeny-tiny floating fairies flying over all the place, and beautiful unicorns, the pinnacle of perfection.<br/>Sucrose and her two best friends believed that if only they could reach this magical place, they would surely live happily ever after.<br/>But time went by, and one of her friends left on a long journey with her adventurer parents, never to return.<br/>The other suffered a domestic tragedy: Her father fell ill and passed away, her whole personality changed, and she broke off her friendship with Sucrose. The promise that they had once made to reunite some day in the future no longer meant anything.<br/>Sucrose felt lonelier then than she ever had felt before in her whole life. They hadn't even set eyes on paradise yet, and already her friends were gone...<br/>Well. Even if they were destined to never meet again, Sucrose was desperate to honor their past friendship in some way. That was when she discovered the existence of alchemy from a book that she was reading.<br/>Sucrose realized: Though she had never had the chance to find the entrance to that wondrous place, she now had the opportunity to be the creator of her own paradise.<br/>Thus began her study of bio-alchemy, and she poured all of her curiosity and passion into it.<br/>Still, she has never once mentioned the story of paradise and her bygone friendships to anyone else.<br/>Perhaps one day, when that place she first learned of in a children's storybook finally becomes a reality in the real world, her friends will return.\"},{\"title\":\"Mist Flower Project 3, Version 17, Enlargement Trial\",\"desc\":\"Sucrose has a set of strict requirements when it comes to the selection of species for her personal paradise. After experimentation, specimens that are up to standard she tags with \\\"pass.\\\"<br/>At first, she wanted to give exotic-sounding names to each of her plants, just like in the stories, but whenever she came to try and name something, she found herself completely at a loss for ideas.<br/>After spending so long as a scientist, she insisted on flawless logic even when it came to relatively trivial matters such as naming.<br/>Her earliest batch of names included the following: \\\"Grassflower,\\\" a flower that grows on grass;<br/>\\\"Flowergrass,\\\" a grass that grows beneath flowers;<br/>\\\"Multigrassflower,\\\" a flower that grows on dense grass, and so on and so forth.<br/>Even such un-paradisiacal names as these would take Sucrose forever to come up with — far longer than the duration of the experiments themselves.<br/>In the end, she gave up on naming altogether and simply used the specimen identifiers from her research notes instead. Yes, this meant the names ended up being much longer, but, but...<br/>...But anyway, Sucrose is the creator of this paradise, so why shouldn't she get to name things any way she wants to?\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"It was on an afternoon just like any other that Sucrose received her Vision.<br/>Ready to begin her one-hundred-and-fifty-ninth dandelion-seed simmering experiment, she poured her carefully crafted alchemical solution into the cauldron.<br/>Instantly, the cauldron hit boiling point, and the entire room was filled with steam. Sucrose rushed to the cauldron, anxious to see what new transmutation had occurred this time; in her excitement, she even burned both of her hands on the lip of the cauldron.<br/>Much to her disappointment, however, the Dandelion Seeds had once again burned to a crisp. But there was something new there, too: lying there amidst the black Dandelion Seeds was a Vision.<br/>And yet, rather than pouring out the liquid and taking her Vision, she first thought for a moment and then lit the fire up again to continue simmering the contents of the cauldron.<br/>She was curious to know what further reactions might occur between Dandelion Seeds and Visions.<br/>Sadly, the experiment ended in failure after three hours of constant simmering.<br/>Still, there was no denying that she had reaped a great reward from this experiment, for the elemental energy provided by her Vision would become her single greatest asset in her future bio-alchemical endeavors.\"}]}\n",

What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking.

No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.<br/>The heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.<br/>The passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.<br/>Today, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"The Yashiro Commission is in charge of ritual matters on Narukami Island, and must also attend to matters of cultural leisure in such a manner that deities and the people alike are pleased — and they do, honoring their commission.<br/>But with greater responsibilities come greater amounts of work.<br/>Fortunately, his sister Ayaka shares much of the clan's responsibilities, with most of the interactions between the Commission and the people falling to her, allowing Ayato to spend most of his time on matters of governance.<br/>Dealing with Shogunate officials is no easy matter. People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.<br/>Ayato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.<br/>Find some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.<br/>And when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?<br/>Over time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.<br/>\\\"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?\\\"<br/>So people would often say.<br/>However, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.<br/>Firstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.<br/>Mostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.<br/>\\\"Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Being limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.<br/>Perhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to \\\"report for work.\\\" In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then \\\"accidentally\\\" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.<br/>In a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.<br/>While walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.<br/>Lately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name \\\"Ayato\\\" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.<br/>On the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.<br/>And of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot — and how proud he is of his sister for that!<br/>Yes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Between the butler and the housekeeper, the Kamisato estate is always spick and span, inside and out... except for one location.<br/>Kamisato Ayato's table is always a terrible mess after he uses it.<br/>Books are strewn about, open and even dumped face-down on the table, while documents of uneven size are stacked haphazardly. The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.<br/>Each time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.<br/>In the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies.<br/>\\\"Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again.\\\"<br/>\\\"Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the Grand Narukami Shrine came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in Ritou. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details.\\\"<br/>\\\"Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry.\\\"<br/>\\\"Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that he/she is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?\\\"<br/>\\\"Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow this old lady to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our housekeeper. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?\\\"<br/>Ayato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the Kamisato Estate will communicate with him through these means.<br/>This was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.<br/>Unfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still... Oh well, just a small sacrifice. Nothing worth writing home about.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"In Inazuma, people will sometimes pray to deities by offering certain kinds of cypress leaves.<br/>But as such rituals lack scale, they are often forgotten amidst the many, both large and small, that are conducted throughout the land.<br/>Though some time has passed, Ayato still remembers his mother mentioning that though these cypresses are evergreen, their leaves are not needle-like.<br/>Instead, they have large, crisp leaves that will not wither and fall even when new ones grow.<br/>As such, it is associated with the concept of \\\"prosperity,\\\" and was often used in ancient times as ritual plating for food offerings.<br/>Today, people no longer use leaves as mats upon which to spread food, but the habit of offering cypress leaves persists nonetheless.<br/>Perhaps it was just a hobby of hers, or perhaps she was just well-read in general, but whatever the case, his mother always had a great deal to say about festival affairs.<br/>\\\"Perhaps the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission were born to protect the deities.\\\"<br/>In his younger years, Ayato had not fully agreed with this statement.<br/>He believed that the Kamisato Clan was the Kamisato Clan, and that it belonged to the family's members. That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.<br/>But such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.<br/>No matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.<br/>With the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the \\\"lessons\\\" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.<br/>His duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the Ogosho, the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace.<br/>\\\"The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally.\\\"<br/>\\\"This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well.\\\"<br/>As for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.<br/>This was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.<br/>As such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.<br/>No matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.<br/>Even if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.<br/>Just as his mother said back then—<br/>\\\"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.<br/>So, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Yumemiru Pen Case\",\"desc\":\"Even Kamisato Ayato himself could not have expected that calligraphy practice, which he had found most boring in his youth, would eventually become a favored pastime of his.<br/>He had slogged through much penmanship practice to better play the part of the Kamisato Clan's eldest son.<br/>But nowadays, he transcribes a few poems from time to time to clear his mind and think in silence.<br/>Of course, this also lets him seem like he is busy with official business even while idle, all the better to avoid seeing some people and doing certain things.<br/>With time's passing, it became agreed among the servants waiting on him that he not only liked to play chess but was also fond of calligraphy.<br/>Such talk would spread widely via word of mouth. As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.<br/>Some of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.<br/>Ayato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.<br/>He has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.<br/>Moreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.<br/>That said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.<br/>One of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.<br/>The second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.<br/>As for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag. Excellent of make and design, it was presented to him by his mother during his adulthood ceremony. \"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"One night, many years ago, Ayato's gravely-ill father summoned him into his presence.<br/>That night, his father seemed a little different from the illness-weathered figure he had become. His expression was solemn, and yet the concern in his eyes was all too clear.<br/>Forcing himself to stay alert, he asked Ayato: was his training done? Had he eaten enough for dinner? How was his swordsmanship progressing?<br/>As Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.<br/>After much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:<br/>\\\"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have.\\\"<br/>After reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.<br/>The moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.<br/>Ayato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.<br/>Since his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.<br/>That this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.<br/>So thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.<br/>Many things flowed through his mind then like a tide:<br/>His father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.<br/>His sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...<br/>They could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...<br/>And as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?<br/>These scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction—<br/>He would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.<br/>That night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.<br/>And when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world.\"}]}\n",

Don't worry, one of my people will be here with umbrellas momentarily.\"},{\"title\":\"When Thunder Strikes\",\"desc\":\"Ayaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Snows\",\"desc\":\"This view reminds me of another time it snowed... that was a long time ago.\"},{\"title\":\"When the Sun Is Out\",\"desc\":\"Opportunities to bask in the sunlight like this are few and far between.\"},{\"title\":\"When It's Windy\",\"desc\":\"Sometimes, what appears at first to be nothing but a passing breeze can ultimately be that which alters the course of events... Hehe.\"},{\"title\":\"When the Wind Is Blowing\",\"desc\":\"Most people hunker down against a strong headwind. Only a few people know how to utilize it to their advantage.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Morning\",\"desc\":\"Good morning. A little sword practice while the day is young is good for the body and mind.

Whatever method you use, the important thing is that it delivers acceptable results.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Most Entertaining\",\"desc\":\"Hehe, I heard about the little job you pulled at the Tenryou Commission.

Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say — I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayaka\",\"desc\":\"I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma\",\"desc\":\"There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sayu\",\"desc\":\"She looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance.

I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... \\\"the Yashiro rascal\\\" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"Old man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"Once upon a time, the Kaedehara Clan was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities...\"},{\"title\":\"About Arataki Itto\",\"desc\":\"Now he's an interesting case. The idea of pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle, I mean really... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him a that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me \\\"bro\\\"... To this day, he calls me \\\"my bro Ayato\\\" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... eccentricities.\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"I have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the Tianquan operates.

Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange? I would have thought you tease your little friend here on a regular basis for precisely that purpose, no?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kamisato Ayato: III\",\"desc\":\"The Tri-Commission may appear calm and well-run, but I can assure you it is quite tumultuous beneath the placid surface. There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan. Neither in the past, when I was working to bring stability to our clan, nor here in the present, where I am working for the sake of all of Inazuma.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kamisato Ayato: IV\",\"desc\":\"You want to know about the Shuumatsuban? I suppose there's no harm in divulging a detail or two to you. It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Kamisato Ayato: V\",\"desc\":\"Do I have other tricks up my sleeve beyond the Shuumatsuban? Well, naturally. If even the cunning bunny burrows thrice, then what of the cunning human? But anyway, I've shared enough of my secrets. I think it's time I heard your story.

In that sense, the Milk Tea Medley they started serving over in Hanamizaka recently isn't half bad. You should try it sometime. Other than that...

I have dedicated staff to arrange my daily meal plan, and whatever they serve, I eat.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food: Trying New Things\",\"desc\":\"You couldn't perchance tell me your own tastes, could you? ...Ah, I see. Okay, I've made a note of that. Now I know what to say the next time I get asked about it.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... it looks like I mixed up my salt and my sugar. Savory Mizu Manjuu. Yes, this can work. I'll give them to Thoma.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy Birthday! Now, how would you like to be Yashiro Commissioner for a day, hmm? All the work has been handled already, so you can focus on simply enjoying the feeling of having an enormous amount of executive power at your fingertips.

While his younger sister, Ayaka, known by all as the Princess, takes care of the clan's internal and external affairs.<br/>Ayaka often appears at social occasions and has more interactions with the common folk. As such, she is better known by the people and has gained a higher reputation than her elder brother. This has earned her the elegant title of Shirasagi Himegimi.<br/>As is known to all, Ayaka, the daughter of the Kamisato family, is a figure greatly admired by the people for her beauty, dignified demeanor, and noble character.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Across Inazuma, all affairs of state that do not go up to the Raiden Shogun are largely handled by the Triarchal Council.<br/>The Council's executive powers are, in turn, divided amongst three groups known as the Tri-Commission: the Yashiro Commission, the Tenryou Commission, and the Kanjou Commission.<br/>The three clans that hold power over these Commissions are as follows: Kamisato, Kujou, and Hiiragi. These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.<br/>Kamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.<br/>When asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...<br/>\\\"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?\\\"<br/>\\\"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma.\\\"<br/>There are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the \\\"Shirasagi Himegimi\\\" nickname actually originated.<br/>Still, Ayaka's popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"As the daughter of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan, Ayaka always has to remain alert to the jostling for power between noble families.<br/>Being young, yet already famed throughout the land, she has been the inevitable target of provocation on the part of other noble scions who have grown jealous of the Kamisato siblings.<br/>The creation and maintenance of a public image may be a formality, but for a house of standing like the Kamisato Clan, even meaningless routine has social significance.<br/>Failing to take part in the tangled web of Inazuman political relations risks their position as head of the Yashiro Commission. As such, the two siblings came to an accord.<br/>The elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.<br/>Through her dignified, demure, and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.<br/>The internal clan affairs are also in her care. Indeed, their estates may have descended into chaos already, if not for her.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"One autumn afternoon, Ayaka was on her way home from completing certain minor affairs when she happened to hear an old voice singing from within an old house.<br/>Within was an old woman, blind in both eyes, whose stick-thin fingers produced music like flowing water as they plucked at her instrument's strings.<br/>Perhaps it was due to her sharp ears, but the old lady heard Ayaka's footsteps and inquired as to who was outside. Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.<br/>As a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the people's lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.<br/>The tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.<br/>Out of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.<br/>Compared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.<br/>That day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?<br/>Returning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.<br/>Afterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.<br/>\\\"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again,\\\" Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, \\\"and they are as lovely as your music.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"In people's imagination, the nobility's living expenses are orders of magnitude above the common folk. So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.<br/>This statement is only half right, however.<br/>Ayaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.<br/>The costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called \\\"wanton.\\\"<br/>The things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.<br/>The making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.<br/>At such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just \\\"Ayaka,\\\" an ordinary girl like any other.<br/>Here, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as \\\"Ayaka\\\" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.<br/>When hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.<br/>Though she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The tutors who guide Ayaka in her various arts once used to say: whether in tea ceremony, chess, the art of the sword, or all other affairs of elegance, Ayaka is already a master.<br/>She is clearly already a noble lady of superb bearing, skilled with both the pen and the sword. To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher's pride and joy.<br/>Still, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?<br/>The essence of tea is peace and quiet.<br/>The heart of the sword is the keenest edge.<br/>The soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.<br/>These three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.<br/>And yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.<br/>That person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.<br/>Only such a person might become Ayaka's bosom friend.<br/>\\\"Surely, this is not too much to ask... But where might I find such a person?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Moriwakamaru\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Come, come, come,\\\"<br/>\\\"Let's play Temari!\\\"<br/>\\\"1, 2, 1, 2, 3,\\\"<br/>\\\"The Temari goes up the Sacred Sakura Tree.\\\"<br/>\\\"4, 5, 4, 5, 6,\\\"<br/>\\\"Woosh, and over Mt. Yougou it flicks!\\\"<br/>\\\"7, 8, 7, 8, 9,\\\"<br/>\\\"The Temari returns into these hands of mine.\\\"<br/>\\\"Yes, into little~ Ayaka's~ hands~!\\\"<br/>This was Ayaka's favorite nursery rhyme back in the day.<br/>Back then, she gave her favorite Temari the name \\\"Moriwakamaru,\\\" and she would dribble the multi-colored Moriwakamaru about while humming this very song.<br/>Hearing her song, her parents and brother would be unable to stop themselves from smiling. Indeed, they would often join in the fun, tossing the Temari between them as a family.<br/>But that was a long time ago, and Ayaka no longer plays games of Temari.<br/>She has become an independent, powerful figure in her own right — and Moriwakamaru, the symbol of her childhood and the bearer of her precious memories, has also been stored away within Ayaka's cabinet.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Some years ago, the Clan underwent a huge change, and a heavy burden fell upon Ayato's shoulders. At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.<br/>She was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan's duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.<br/>But seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.<br/>So she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.<br/>Truth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.<br/>Yet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.<br/>\\\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times.\\\" — This was something her mother told her.<br/>When her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer \\\"Little Ayaka.\\\" She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun's three great clans.<br/>Sword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.<br/>On one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.<br/>\\\"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times\\\" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved.\"}]}\n",

She is, however, a loyal servant to Inazuma, there is no question about that.\"},{\"title\":\"About Shikanoin Heizou\",\"desc\":\"Mr. Shikanoin belongs to the Tenryou Commission, just like Miss Kujou.

Since I see you as a friend, it would only be fair to be open and honest with you, but if this means sharing secrets of the Kamisato Clan... I would ask that you keep anything I tell you in strict confidence.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Kamisato Ayaka: II\",\"desc\":\"The Kamisato Clan once suffered a major blow when we failed to protect a swordsmith of national significance. We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Kamisato Ayaka: III\",\"desc\":\"The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Kamisato Ayaka: IV\",\"desc\":\"My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.\"},{\"title\":\"More about Kamisato Ayaka: V\",\"desc\":\"What I want to say next is perhaps not befitting of a member of the Inazuma Shogunate, Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Clan, but... unless I am mistaken, I trust that you will not take issue with this slight departure from convention on my part...<br/>That is to say...

And you?\"},{\"title\":\"Kamisato Ayaka's Troubles: Concerns\",\"desc\":\"Troubles? Well, I mean... that's life, isn't it? There will always be things that don't go one's way. But I do not wish to worry those around me on account of things that are my concern alone... so, it is best if I keep them to myself.\"},{\"title\":\"Kamisato Ayaka's Troubles: Desires\",\"desc\":\"Openness is something I find very difficult. I constantly have to remind myself that as a lady of the Kamisato Clan, there are countless people watching and countless expectations to live up to. I must be a model of exemplary conduct at all times. But even so, shouldn't I still follow my dreams? Shouldn't I... share my true feelings with you?\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I'm fascinated by food from overseas. Though I don't get to try it very often...

We're not going far away — I promise it won't delay you too much.<br/>I managed to find out when your birthday was well in advance, so I could prepare in good time. Hopefully this wasn't assuming too much, but I guessed you might prefer this to an expensive gift.<br/>In honor of your birthday, please allow me to perform a fan dance for you.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Thank you very much.

She does not work together with her church colleagues and only rarely shows up to celebratory events in the city.<br/>The strange and mysterious Rosaria moves about almost like a wisp of black smoke — blink, and you'll miss her as she disappears into thin air.<br/>Her social interactions are never more than superficial, and the rest of the time she keeps herself to herself.<br/>However, Sister Victoria would say that the ever good-natured Barbara is one person who has always made the effort to get close to Rosaria.<br/>\\\"Please don't smoke in the Cathedral...\\\" \\\"Could you try to attend the ceremony on time next time...?\\\"<br/>\\\"And... Hey, come back, I'm still talking to you!\\\"<br/>Barbara is forever anxiously chasing after Rosaria, urging her to complete her various daily tasks.<br/>Yet even when faced with Barbara, the beloved idol of Mondstadt, Rosaria remains completely unmoved.<br/>Surely her heart can't be completely made of stone?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Rosaria's movements are unpredictable. She often leaves without notifying anyone and can be gone for up to several days on end.<br/>During these times, none of her church colleagues know where to find her.<br/>One of the sisters who took it upon herself to observe Rosaria once groused that \\\"even a stray cat should at least give you notice before running off...\\\"<br/>Rosaria uses these disappearances to do work that only she can do in corners unseen by others.<br/>An unfamiliar merchant, a suspicious traveler — are these people threats to Mondstadt?<br/>She investigates, shadows, and if necessary, interrogates.<br/>If they must disappear, then Rosaria shall be the last person they meet.<br/>Such dark work, which cannot see the light of day, is to be done by her hand alone.<br/>She always sets out after the sun has set, finishing her work in one fell swoop. Sometimes, if she makes it back by the crack of dawn, she gets to usher in the day ahead with a glass of breakfast wine.<br/>The people of Mondstadt live in the golden sunlight, but Rosaria dwells under the silver moonlight.<br/>It is a cold, piercing light... just like that of the ice she forms with her Cryo abilities.<br/>\\\"There are some things that young people need not know,\\\" Rosaria thinks.<br/>Though, in her eyes, \\\"young people\\\" means all citizens of Mondstadt who live in the light of the sun, regardless of their age.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Like a puff of smoke, the lackadaisical Rosaria is impossible to pin down.<br/>Nevertheless, once she takes on a job, she can be relied on to handle it with the utmost professionalism.<br/>\\\"Lazy\\\" is the last word that anyone would use to describe her ruthless interrogations of suspicious individuals.<br/>She also possesses exceptional strength and knows the weaknesses of the human body like the back of her hand — and has no reservations about using this knowledge to kill.<br/>People know her as the lazy, chain-smoking sister, but behind the scenes, she is a formidable purveyor of justice.<br/>A strange fate for one who ostensibly basks in the light of the gods.<br/>What led her to become a blood-soaked slayer? Why does she stay silent while others praise the gods for their protection?<br/>Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Rosaria was not born and bred in Mondstadt.<br/>\\\"A city that is fortunate enough to be boring always needs someone to do the dirty work...\\\"<br/>Rosaria stubs her cigarette out as she speaks in her characteristically languid manner.<br/>\\\"And as far as I'm concerned, the things I deal with are far simpler than living the life of a traditional sister.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Rosaria may not be one to attend prayer meetings, but that does not mean she doesn't have her own theological viewpoints.<br/>In her view, freedom is the spiritual pillar of Mondstadt's people, and it is the very thing that caused her to end up here in the first place.<br/>Rosaria was born in a remote mountain village, but was taken from her home shortly after birth by the very same bandits who drenched it in blood.<br/>Raised by those crooks, she learned how to fight, sometimes thieving, other times doing odd jobs for the crew.<br/>She was their servant, but also their tool, a crook, yet still a child.<br/>She fought against outsiders and her comrades alike, and growing up was a constant battle for survival against the hunger and cold.<br/>Rosaria's youth was just like Mondstadt's sunset — blood-red from horizon to horizon, and so fleeting that night had fallen before she'd had the chance to stop and take in the view.<br/>Ultimately, the bandit crew was wiped out by the Knights of Favonius. As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.<br/>Grand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:<br/>\\\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\\\"<br/>But Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.<br/>She would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.<br/>For Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Rosaria, the Church's number one truant, became infamous for her absence very early on.<br/>\\\"Miss Rosaria, please, show a little more circumspection in your actions! You are a member of the Church. How is it appropriate that you simply never turn up for hymn practice?\\\"<br/>\\\"Please calm down, Sister Ophila. Miss Rosaria, I'm told that you have never attended a single one of your compulsory classes. Is that so?\\\"<br/>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br/>\\\"Mother Maria, please look at this... Rosaria's theological essay is an utter mess!\\\"<br/>\\\"Miss Rosaria, if I may ask frankly... do you intend to do any work at all here at the Church?\\\"<br/>\\\"No. I've already found other work.\\\"<br/>Rosaria never showed so much as a hint of anxiety in any of these exchanges. What's more, it was true — she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.<br/>The unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.<br/>Rosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.<br/>Nevertheless, when she's not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.<br/>And when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.<br/>The instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.<br/>Whether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.\"},{\"title\":\"Church-Issue Journal\",\"desc\":\"A journal with a white cover. The words \\\"Church of Favonius\\\" are inscribed on the cover.<br/>The handwriting is beautiful, but the content is the most of the most banal variety imaginable.<br/>\\\"Dandelion Wine — now eighty percent off!\\\"<br/>\\\"Fisherman's Toast — an incredible flavor at an unbelievable price!\\\"<br/>\\\"Crazy discounts on Wheat — ask at the counter and we'll grind it into Flour for you.\\\"<br/>\\\"Buy three Tomatoes and get one free!\\\"<br/>\\\"Fresh Small Lamp Grass! Use it to light up your bathroom! Come on, Sir, have a look!\\\"<br/>There is something incongruous about a random assortment of marketplace cries and advertising slogans having been penned by such a graceful and elegant hand.<br/>This journal is a relic from Rosaria's novice days.<br/>Clearly, she must have skipped class and headed to the rooftops on the merchant street, bathing in the sun, listening to the eclectic cries of the street vendors, and committing them to paper.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Rosaria's Vision came to her on a particularly frigid night.<br/>Things were getting desperate for the bandit gang — people were starving and the food supplies were dwindling.<br/>Never able to eat her fill, Rosaria was driven by hunger to flee into the freezing wind rather than continue another second with the hard labor she was forced to endure.<br/>One of the elders of the gang pursued her and brought her back.<br/>He was the very person who had taken her from the village of her birth, and the one who had taught her how to kill.<br/>\\\"Fleeing makes you a traitor, and traitors can only earn their freedom through victory in combat.\\\"<br/>The old bandit tossed Rosaria an old dagger.<br/>\\\"Well, come on then! Kill me, and you can leave this place. I'm long in the tooth now, while you've got youth on your side. You can do this, can't ya?\\\"<br/>No one thought that she would be able to kill him — and yet, the old lion would indeed fall by the newborn cub's claws.<br/>Thus did the bandits lose an old member and welcome a new one that very night.<br/>The bandits were reluctant to accept Rosaria at first since she had slain one of their own, but they quickly had a change of heart after seeing the Vision in her hand.<br/>Surely, a Vision wielder had to be far stronger than some old coot who was about to kick the bucket right? And she ate less, to boot... They could save some food this way.<br/>Meanwhile, a question crept into Rosaria's frozen heart:<br/>Did he let me replace him on purpose? ...Could a false father have harbored genuine affection for a child he stole so arbitrarily?\"}]}\n",

Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.<br/>Her antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.<br/>Hu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.<br/>It is only during funeral ceremonies, when she personally leads her undertakers through lamp-lit alleys, that she shows her dignified and solemn side.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Funeral ceremonies allow mortals to leave this world with dignity.<br/> And Liyue's Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is said to be painting the last strokes on the scrolls of people's lives in the most respectful way.<br/>Traditional funerals include multiple steps such as holding a wake, burial, putting up a memorial plaque... All of which are subject to strict rules.<br/>Regardless of their social standing and level of wealth, all who depart deserve a ceremony that would do them honor. This is the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's client service philosophy.<br/>One would think that such a reputable organization ought to be led only by an individual of utmost learning and sagacity.<br/>Yet the heavy mantle of the 77th Director has fallen on the shoulders of a young lady like Hu Tao.<br/>She has got quite a reputation in Liyue. Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.<br/>Although she is widely praised for her wit and shrewdness, her eccentric notions are not as welcome, as she often lets her imagination run wild.<br/>As a three-year-old, she would read through volumes of classic texts while doing handstands. At six, she would cut classes and fall asleep in coffins. When she was eight, she started living in the parlor and learning the etiquette of funeral ceremonies...<br/>One would never use the word \\\"measured\\\" to describe her behavior.<br/>During her teenage years, Hu Tao was tasked with conducting a funeral ceremony for the first time.<br/>The parlor's undertakers and consultants were anticipating her debut with their stomachs in knots as if they were suspended over the peaks of Jueyun Karst.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Fortunately, Hu Tao treats the parlor's operations with the utmost importance and is always looking to grow her business.<br/>\\\"At the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, the living give us Mora to see the dead on their way. We have a responsibility to both parties, so we gotta make sure both sides are happy.\\\"<br/>When it comes to the parlor's rules, Hu Tao knows them all like the back of her hand.<br/>Each day when the parlor closes its doors, Hu Tao invites consultants from different walks of life to pass their teachings on to the undertakers.<br/>\\\"The funeral tradition is like science. It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\\\"<br/>Of all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.<br/>Despite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.<br/>Apart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.<br/>\\\"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony, some opt for a more lively style of event. There are also wealthier clients who would request a funeral arrangement of the most pompous kind. The services we provide have to be tailor-made according to the clients' needs.\\\"<br/>Ever since Hu Tao took over, the parlor's operations have been solid and reliable, with ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.<br/>Even so, Hu Tao still has a tendency to wander off, disappearing as soon as her undertakers are busy listening to lectures.<br/>The hobbies and interests of this young director are just as eccentric as her personality, and yet it is difficult to say with certainty if those activities are of a purely leisurely nature.<br/>Hu Tao's shadow can be seen in the moonlit docks or at the highest, most precarious viewpoints in the mountains, where she's likely to take in the scenery and shape her thoughts into beautiful poetry.<br/>She loves to roam freely at night, looking for inspiration. When it strikes her, no matter where she is, she cannot help but compose a poem on the spot.<br/>If they are particularly lucky, the traveling merchants taking respite around the Huaguang Stone Forest can spot a mysterious girl keeping herself amused in solitude.<br/>Hu Tao can play a four-player card game accompanied by no one for hours on end.<br/>That said, the joys of engaging in such activities remain a mystery to all but Hu Tao herself.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"The Ministry of Civil Affairs is guarded by two life-like stone lions, a symbol of power and authority.<br/>However, Hu Tao, who happened to be passing by the ministry building one day, saw them in a different light. At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.<br/>From that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names — Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.<br/>On occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her actual pets.<br/>As it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building. One day, some city folk came to play with the restaurant's favorite, providing an interesting foil for Hu Tao's peculiarities. Met with befuddled gazes of the bystanders, Hu Tao showed unwavering confidence.<br/>\\\"Sure, your kitty's cute, but the same can be said about my Whiskers and Mittens. Their fur might be harder, but they're still just as fluffy! Any animal that brings people joy may become a pet. And when it comes to majestic looks, your little fur-ball simply can't measure up to my lions!\\\"<br/>Suffice to say that this explanation was met with even greater consternation from the onlookers.<br/>Yet the group of people shocked the most and most often by Hu Tao's antics were the ministry guards. Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials. To their unceasing surprise, it would turn out to just be a young lady playing with the stone lions.<br/>The guards were faced with an even bigger conundrum when, once everyone had reluctantly got used to her presence, Hu Tao discontinued her visits.<br/>That meant that the responsibility for cleaning the statues fell on the guards' shoulders once again.<br/>Subsequently, they decided to keep guard by the lions for many days, anticipating Hu Tao's return. Once they finally had the opportunity to ask her why she would not visit anymore, they received the most absurd of answers.<br/>\\\"Whiskers and Mittens are adults now and can take care of themselves! Excuse me, I'm running late for my heart-to-heart with a Statue of the Seven regarding the meaning of life!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Not long after her initial meeting with the little zombie, Hu Tao decided that, as her self-proclaimed true friend, she should grant Qiqi eternal peace.<br/>Hu Tao would go on to kidnap Qiqi several times following much deliberation in every instance, including calculating the most auspicious time for the ceremony, aiming to follow the standard procedure of cremation, after which she would place Qiqi in a tomb on the outskirts of the city.<br/>In fact, she would have succeeded already if not for Baizhu's timely interventions.<br/>Each time the Bubu Pharmacy's owner managed to catch up with them, Hu Tao had already had Qiqi packed in a bag, with only her head sticking out, staring in utter confusion as Hu Tao was vigorously digging a hole for the pyre.<br/>Afterwards, Hu Tao sent Qiqi an apology letter, in which she expressed deep regret that she had not been able to lay Qiqi to rest fast enough.<br/>In Hu Tao's eyes, Qiqi passed away a long time ago, but has been trapped in this world and cannot free herself of her eternal suffering.<br/>Baizhu, for his part, had grown ever more relentless in his pursuit of eternal life after meeting Qiqi. This act of defiance against the cycle of life and death was unacceptable to Hu Tao.<br/>She wanted to bury Qiqi not only out of consideration for her friend but also to restore the natural order.<br/>But Qiqi could not disagree more, as she was afraid of death and disliked Hu Tao for her attempts.<br/>Because the struggle between Hu Tao and her had been going on for so long, Qiqi has experienced a breakthrough. She has started to remember places where she might hide to avoid being captured by Hu Tao.<br/>Perhaps it was due to those desperate survival efforts that Hu Tao decided to do something unusual and dig deeper into Qiqi's past.<br/>The story of her accident and the mystery of the adepti... That series of coincidences filled Hu Tao's heart with hesitation.<br/>Since Qiqi's will to live is so strong, she should not be forced to move on. Given the circumstances, she could only be treated as a rare exception that eludes the natural laws.<br/>Ever since, Hu Tao's attitude towards Qiqi has changed drastically, to the point that she would pamper her.<br/>Unfortunately, the damage has been done and Hu Tao has become Qiqi's bugbear. The little zombie may need several years more to let go of her grievances.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Hu Tao is not, in fact, best known for her role as Director, but for her other great accomplishment: the creation of poetry.<br/>She dubs herself the \\\"versemonger of the darkest alleys,\\\" and free verse flows forth untamed from her mouth whenever she has free time to be out on the streets.<br/>The \\\"Hilitune\\\" is Hu Tao's most famous work, well-loved not only by the people of the harbor, but ever on the lips of children as far as Qingce Village as well.<br/>Hobbyists and critics alike were greatly surprised by the simple but profound originality of the \\\"Hilitune\\\" and its creation, and went to Wanwen Bookhouse in droves to search for the works of this great poet. Unfortunately, Hu Tao's anthologies, named \\\"Fiddlesticks\\\" and \\\"Of Common Lives\\\" respectively, have yet to be published.<br/>Xingqiu, ever immersed in books, also wanted to meet this strange person, and so chose an auspicious date to visit, bringing a gift with him.<br/>The two hit it off immediately, and they exchanged pointers and impromptu poetry in Wangsheng's main hall — and when faced with the poetry of Xingqiu's traditional, artistic bent, Hu Tao could always return in kind with some strange and marvelous verse.<br/>And there was meaning in the chaos, indeed, a rhythm to the bizarre that anyone could perceive, and it was catchy, too.<br/>Thus did she \\\"beat the old master with untrained fists,\\\" leaving Xingqiu at a loss for words.<br/>At length, the poetic spar ended amiably, and they have been friends ever since, reading and composing poetry with one another when they have the time to meet.<br/>Over time, Chongyun, too, was pulled in to serve as an umpire, their laughter filling the streets.<br/>The poems born from these sessions would also be recorded by bystanders.<br/>If ever you should hear a pair of matched verses, one strict and the other playful, you are most likely to have heard one created jointly by Hu Tao and Xingqiu.\"},{\"title\":\"Harmony Hexagram Hat\",\"desc\":\"This hat is somewhat on the hard side, and the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor adorns its front.<br/>It is said that this hat was passed from the 75th Director to Hu Tao. However, that director was large, musclebound, and had a head at least two sizes larger than hers.<br/>Ultimately, Hu Tao had to spend an entire day and night to modify the hat with her own hands such that its dimensions would fit hers. When she meets others, she tells them: this hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!<br/>The undertakers laugh and leave it at that, but the 77th Director clearly does treasure that hat.<br/>No matter the rain or storm, or if Hu Tao returns late covered in muck, that hat will remain spotless and clean.<br/>The plum blossom that adorns the side of the hat is plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao planted and grew herself.<br/>Its creation process is as follows: pluck and air-dry, then paint, lacquer, and outline carefully before sun-drying for three days and voila — a beautiful accessory, soft to the touch and bearing a delicate fragrance.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"This tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather.<br/>Ten days before the funeral itself, Old Hu had passed away following a bout of illness. For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.<br/>Only thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.<br/>After the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.<br/>Heading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the \\\"border.\\\" It is the line that separates life and death, the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to legend, it is a place where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.<br/>For two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.<br/>She stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:<br/>\\\"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\\\"<br/>Not one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.<br/>She laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \\\"Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\\\"<br/>The old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.<br/>At last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms?<br/>With a smile, she set forth on the return journey.<br/>The faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \\\"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\\\"<br/>It was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.<br/>With her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?<br/>As one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.<br/>Perhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength.\"}]}\n",

You're completely out of tune!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Barbara's feelings on her own success are mixed.<br/>To the extent that an idol's duty is to make everyone adore her, she has done a fantastic job.<br/>There is no doubting that she has made the right choice.<br/>However, an idol is also expected to spread joy and relieve people's spiritual fatigue... Has she really accomplished that?<br/>She sang for blind Glory, encouraging her to believe that her lover would one day return. She sang, too, for sick Anna, promising her that her illness would one day be cured.<br/>Yet, the smiles on their faces never last long after the songs end.<br/>This has led Barbara to become somewhat disillusioned and doubtful.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Barbara has always been a bright and optimistic girl since she was young. Though at times she can be a bit clumsy and mess things up, she always bounces right back and has another go.<br/>Barbara is the complete opposite of her sister, who is seen by all as the pride of her family.<br/>Unlike Barbara, her sister has always been the very definition of success in all aspects.<br/>Initially, all Barbara had ever wanted was to surpass her sister in at least one thing, even if only once.<br/>However, be it swordplay, her grades, or anything else, she was never able to compare.<br/>Even for someone as optimistic as her, she found herself to be upset and down.<br/>\\\"Hard work is the most miraculous magic. But when even that doesn't work... what then?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Barbara has never once considered giving up.<br/>Her determination and resilience even surprised her father, Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak.<br/>Barbara only allows herself to be depressed for 30 seconds.<br/>After that, she forces herself to brighten up, no matter what.<br/>\\\"I'm not so good in combat, so I'll be sure to support those who are.\\\"<br/>Under her father's counsel, Barbara became a healer.<br/>She is as radiant as the sick and injured are pained.<br/>Her desire to be recognized gradually transformed into a simple desire to help others.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Thank you\\\" are the two words that Barbara hears most often.<br/>When she feels lost, she will suddenly find that there is someone wanting to hold her hand.<br/>\\\"Thanks for being here with me. I feel so much better.\\\"<br/>To Barbara, the greatest reward is seeing the smiles on people's faces.<br/>Therefore, whenever she is massaging her swollen calves or drinking tea to care for her sore throat, Barbara recalls all those who have been kind to her.<br/>\\\"It's the encouragement I receive from others that keeps me going.\\\"<br/>Just maybe, the smiles she receives are proof that her songs really can heal people.<br/>Her ambition to surpass her sister and become the most popular person in all of Mondstadt hasn't been abandoned by Barbara, it is simply buried deep inside her heart.<br/>\\\"If only I excelled more, perhaps I could be of help to Jean.\\\"<br/>This is what she believes.<br/>\\\"Okay... Barbara, go!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Alice's Idol Magazine\",\"desc\":\"\\\"...Idol?\\\"<br/>The first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused.<br/>\\\"But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?\\\"<br/>\\\"Yes, but not exclusively...\\\" replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. \\\"Read this, it contains everything you will need to know.\\\"<br/>\\\"Idol Magazine\\\" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an \\\"idol,\\\" and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.<br/>She also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.<br/>Barbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.<br/>Some time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for \\\"Teyvat Idols!\\\" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.<br/>\\\"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!\\\"<br/>Driven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"The story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.<br/>She had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.<br/>Nothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.<br/>Someone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.<br/>Another suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.<br/>Barbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?<br/>\\\"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need,\\\" Barbara thought to herself.<br/>And so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.<br/>It was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.<br/>Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.<br/>Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.<br/>Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.<br/>Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song.\"}]}\n",

Unfortunately, they interrupted him not two minutes into the explanation before marking him down as \\\"unemployed.\\\"<br/>That designation is not exactly accurate, of course: other than the Gang's activities, which the Shogunate does not acknowledge, Itto does also do some odd jobs to stay solvent, usually working one day before taking three days off.<br/>As such, a more accurate designation should have been \\\"three-quarters unemployed.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Objectively speaking, Itto's reputation leaves much to be desired within Inazuma City.<br/>Even though he is not considered a villain, he is certainly no law-abiding citizen either. If one really had to assign some sort of hazard level to him, then perhaps the level of being used by parents to keep naughty children in line (\\\"If you don't behave, Arataki Itto will come and snatch your snacks away!\\\" for example) might suffice.<br/>That said, unlike threats of \\\"the Great Mujina Youkai grabbing you and taking you deep into the mountains,\\\" or \\\"being inlaid upon the Shogun's statue,\\\" the scenario threatened here can actually occur.<br/>Still, \\\"snatching\\\" is, again, not accurate, for the fate of these snacks is decided fair and square by ritual combat!<br/>In the eyes of many, winning snacks off kids in competitions is exceedingly shameless, but Itto believes that every battle must be taken seriously, whether one's foe is a 5-year old child or the Almighty Shogun herself.<br/>It is also due to this conviction that Itto can lose to a child without any reservations at all.<br/>And while the adults have much to say about his behavior, the children find Itto the big oni to be a rather good playmate.<br/>He is knowledgeable about all manner of street games and plays them all with great gusto. He also stands up for any who are being bullied.<br/>Lately, the children have been very into Onikabuto battles against Itto.<br/>The rules of this game are simple and the fighting is both fierce and very watchable. Most importantly of all, they actually have a pretty decent chance of winning this one, unlike with other games.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"For the longest time, the Tenryou Commission has regarded the Arataki Gang as a group of only occasional troublemakers who do not require that much attention.<br/>This group only has less than 10 regular members and there are many internal disagreements concerning the date of its founding.<br/>Akira believes that it all began when Itto saved him from a few two-bit ruffians. That day, Itto persisted even after having been knocked to the ground 7 times, ultimately causing the punks to back off in annoyance. Helping Akira up from the ground, Itto declared: \\\"Well, guess you're with the Arataki Gang now!\\\"<br/>Genta and Mamoru believe that the Gang was truly founded at the end of a certain year when they all squatted on the outskirts of Inazuma City and roasted Lavender Melons.<br/>That day, not one of them had a single Mora to their name, and they were all very hungry indeed. While gorging himself on a melon, Itto said with a sigh, \\\"We should roast Lavender Melons like this every year!\\\"<br/>That said, neither Genta nor Mamoru thinks that these experiences need much memorializing.<br/>For Kuki Shinobu, the Gang was officially formed the first time she had to drag Itto's sorry behind out of Shogunate gaol, for this was the first time any official records had ever made mention of the Arataki Gang.<br/>As for Itto, he believes that the Arataki Gang existed from the first moment those words entered his mind.<br/>Unfortunately, he no longer remembers when that was.<br/>And as for Granny Oni, who has taken care of Itto since he was young, she believes that the Gang was never formed.<br/>To her, these children are just \\\"Itto and his friends.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"The land of Inazuma has been home to the oni race since antiquity.<br/>They existed here alongside the lordly Hakushin kitsune bloodline and the tengu.<br/>Such youkai often have supernatural abilities that humans could only look upon in envy, but the oni lack many special traits in that regard.<br/>Other than the horns on their heads, they are mostly remembered for their explosive tempers and penchant for making trouble.<br/>As for their legendary fear of beans, it has a scientific basis.<br/>As it turns out, oni are allergic to beans. However, because the oni bloodline has thinned out greatly over time, most people display only very minor allergic reactions.<br/>Unfortunately for Itto, his allergies are pretty still pretty severe. Forget eating beans, so long as he makes skin contact with them, Itto will get itchy all over and even find it hard to breathe.<br/>This thus makes beans the only thing that the usually carefree Itto is particularly wary of in his daily life.<br/>For their part, the Arataki Gang members do not order any dishes made with beans, not even in private, as a mark of respect for him.<br/>Of all products made with beans, Itto fears Fried Tofu the most — indeed, even he says that the very sight of it leaves him feeling queasy for three days straight.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"And when one mentions Fried Tofu, a certain pyrrhic victory immediately comes to mind.<br/>The battle that caused that incident began as a rather pedestrian conflict: a fox-eared lady had happened to sit in the chair that Itto would customarily sit on while eating at his favorite food stand... and on his payday, no less.<br/>The two began a contest of words over whom the chair belonged to, culminating in a straight-up (unnecessary) battle.<br/>Itto, hungry from a hard day's work, chose an eating contest, while the fox-eared lady chose a theme of \\\"kitsune ramen.\\\"<br/>Itto was momentarily at a loss when he realized that said ramen contained Fried Tofu, but with the oni race's pride on the line, he soldiered on gamely en route to victory nonetheless.<br/>And as for that innocent chair, it was ultimately given to Itto as a trophy by the rather mortified owner of the food stand.<br/>Regarding the various contests he has been in, there are two that still weigh on Itto's mind quite heavily.<br/>One of them is the rematch that he demanded of Kujou Sara, who defeated him and took his Vision as part of her duties in the Tenryou Commission.<br/>To this day, the Kujou has not agreed to the street corner sumo match, something that frustrates Itto to no end.<br/>The other incident happened many years ago when Itto was young. Then, he had gotten into an argument with a young tengu, the result of which was a sumo match in the Byakko Plain. Unexpectedly, the ensuing furor sent them both rolling down a mountain.<br/>In the end, it was the tengu who carried Itto, who could not walk after spraining his ankle, all the way home. Of course, the match went unsettled.<br/>Just his luck, Itto often thinks, that both such incidents had to do with tengu!<br/>Also, how on earth were these tengu all so strong despite looking so skinny?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Every oni child has probably heard the story of the Crimson Oni and the Blue Oni:<br/>The gentle, helpful Crimson Oni defeated the wicked Blue Oni, thus winning the respect of the humans.<br/>This was Itto's favorite story when he was young, and he was proud of his red oni horns and his Crimson Oni lineage.<br/>However, this simple pride was shaken by a certain incident.<br/>When incidents of robbery occurred in the village in which Itto lived, the Arataki family fell under suspicion on account of their oni heritage.<br/>Itto no longer remembers the details of that incident, but he remembers the wary, disgusted stares the villagers gave him and his parents as they left, and the parting words they said, which Itto has heard countless times since:<br/>\\\"Once an oni, always an oni.\\\"<br/>No matter the time period, all oni are the same as far as humans are concerned. In that case, would it not be better to become the Blue Oni, whom people feared? Surely that was preferable to being like his parents, who were driven out despite having done nothing wrong.<br/>After his parents died of illness, the young Itto was turned out onto the streets, where he would lay into anyone who spoke ill of the oni race.<br/>Well, Itto was mostly the one getting laid into. But he proved quite the pain in the neck, never giving up no matter how many times they knocked him down.<br/>Still, he was only a child and eventually collapsed on the street due to exhaustion and hunger after a terrible round of beatings at the hands of some ruffians who had banded together against him.<br/>At this moment of crisis, Itto was saved by an old human woman.<br/>\\\"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?\\\" \\\"You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge.\\\"<br/>\\\"I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?\\\" \\\"Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?\\\"<br/>\\\"Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please.\\\" \\\"Coming right up.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"The Great Singalong\",\"desc\":\"As the year was drawing to a close, the Arataki Gang met to discuss how they might celebrate the turnover of the year.<br/>As opposed to more reputable organizations, the Arataki Gang did not have any fixed venues to hold their activities, which posed some... logistical issues.<br/>The Lavender Melon suggestion was quickly eliminated. While roasting melons itself was certainly not an issue, eating only that to celebrate the new year certainly was.<br/>An Onikabuto festival was considered, but the year's end was not mating season, and so the contestants would not be half as motivated as they usually were.<br/>Ultimately, lots were drawn, and the \\\"Great Singalong\\\" was selected.<br/>This activity was suggested by Itto himself, and it entailed everyone standing on a cliff and singing against the ocean wind to express their innermost feelings and well-wishes for the future.<br/>The various gang members actually rejected this in their hearts when they found out about it. After all, screaming into the wind was nowhere near as fun as eating melons. Kuki Shinobu even indicated that she would like to take leave to return home on that day.<br/>However, the event went through nonetheless. The yelling and hollering were indeed quite soothing for the soul — and as things unexpectedly turned out, Itto was quite the good singer as well.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Itto's Vision was something he found under his hip after waking up one morning. By that point, he had already been in Hanamizaka for many a year, and his livelihood was at least somewhat stable.<br/>\\\"Well I never! Dad, Mom, Gramps, Granny, and Granny Oni, this... Now isn't this something?\\\"<br/>These were Itto's real thoughts as he first looked upon his Vision.<br/>That day, he would excitedly show his Vision to every person he met, even showing people where it had made an indentation on his back until everyone was thoroughly sick of hearing the story.<br/>A few days later, however, the story would change a little:<br/>\\\"Now as you know, I wasn't surprised at all when I first saw that Vision. I mean, you'd expect as much out of the first and greatest head of the Arataki Gang, after all!\\\"<br/>\\\"More importantly, a person's worth isn't something that can be determined by a mere Vision, oh no, sir!\\\"<br/>The keen-eyed, however, would notice that Itto had bought a very soft spectacle cloth.<br/>Also, a certain question showed up in the advice column of the \\\"That's Life\\\" magazine that went like this:<br/>\\\"Ms. Hina, how should I best take care of my Vision and make it shinier? And when I say 'shinier,' I mean shinier than everyone else's, of course!\\\"<br/>When gang members read this and excitedly showed the magazine to Itto, they were surprised to see the long-time fan of Ms. Hina just look at the mag casually before laying it aside.\"}]}\n",

But hey, who needs some lousy job when we can just go find somewhere fun to hang out! Haha, whaddya say?\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Now that we've had some grub, why don't we go find somewhere to kick it for a while? Hanamizaka? Nah, boring. Tenryou Commission...

Haha... Literally.\"},{\"title\":\"About Itto: Getting a Real Job\",\"desc\":\"Oh, so they're saying I can't hold down a real job, huh? Well! Hahaha! Sorry to break it to ya, but I'm a delinquent. That means it's my job to not have a real job, and if anyone's got a problem with that... Who's got a problem with that, huh? You got a problem with that!? You got a problem with— *coughing* Sorry. Got a little worked up there. Where was I? Ah yeah, so work isn't really my thing, but don't worry — I don't rob or steal or anything like that. When I'm really runnin' low on funds, I just take the odd job here and there to make ends meet. You know, like transporting stuff, delivering documents, helping businesses attract customers... Just enough to keep the wolf from the door. Hehe!\"},{\"title\":\"About Itto: Oni\",\"desc\":\"The oni have been through a lot to get to where we are today, and look at us now — living peacefully alongside the humans. Unfortunately, there's still plenty of people out there who've got a bone to pick with us. Hmm? Change? Oh yeah, things are gonna change, alright! You can count on that! But I'll tell you what, it won't involve any sucking up to the humans on my part, nuh-uh! I'm gonna let my actions do the talkin'. They'll come to respect me eventually.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Cooperation\",\"desc\":\"Hey, so I always see you running around everywhere doing this and that for other people, but you're not in it for the Mora, are you? No, you're just straight-up lookin' out for your fellow man. I know a true homie when I see one, and no one appreciates a homies' homie more than yours truly. Put it here, partner! You and I are gonna make a great team, I just know it!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Response\",\"desc\":\"You know what, I gotta admit — I respect you, always have. I could really see you as a member of the gang, you know — I mean, you really have what it takes... Whaddya say? I've even come up with a catchy title to tag on after your name, get this: \\\"The Traveler, 'Second to One'\\\"! Get it? 'Cause y'know, I'm numero uno, you're my number two, and together we're the most powerful duo in the whole friggin' world, baby! Hahaha! Ah... But, uh, all jokes aside, I know you're on some important journey or whatever. So, go ahead! Get out there and do whatcha wanna do! Just remember, the Arataki Gang will always answer your call.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"Ugh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions — which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right? But nooo, some class-A jerk in the Tenryou Commission thought it'd be funny to put my Vision right at the very bottom! Ugh... Come on!\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Hina\",\"desc\":\"If you ever have something on your mind, you can always try writing in to \\\"That's Life\\\" magazine's advice column. Ms. Hina always manages to come up with an encouraging and heartwarming response for all her readers. Just look at me — I used to be a lost soul, but not anymore, and it's all thanks to her. Oh, that reminds me, I managed to sign up for one of her upcoming meet-and-greets! I've been counting down the days — wish it would go faster...\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Horns\",\"desc\":\"Question for ya! Do my horns look boring once you get used to them? 'Cause, uh, I was thinking of switching up the style, going for a total overhaul, you know? I'm thinking paint them in rainbow stripes and then strap a few Fireflies on for good measure! Eh, eh? I bet that would turn some heads on the streets... like \\\"Dude, you're rockin' those sweet rainbow horns, man!\\\" ...Ah, man, this is totally genius! I'm gonna round up the gang and get them working on it ASAP.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"Wanna know the real secret to catching Onikabuto? It's all in the eyeballs. You gotta keep those bad boys squeaky clean at all times, make sure your eyesight's as sharp as a hawk. Trust me, when you're in the middle of a thunderstorm, and the rain's coming down, and the wind's blowing in your face, you gotta watch out, because Lavender Melons and Onikabuto? Well, they can really start to look the same... believe me, I know.\"},{\"title\":\"About Thoma\",\"desc\":\"Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like — are you kidding me??? How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kamisato Ayato\",\"desc\":\"Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. \\\"You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs\\\"... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Yeah, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yoimiya\",\"desc\":\"Hmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaedehara Kazuha\",\"desc\":\"Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!\"},{\"title\":\"About the Raiden Shogun\",\"desc\":\"During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Lady with Fox Ears\",\"desc\":\"I crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!\"},{\"title\":\"About Kujou Sara\",\"desc\":\"You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that.\"},{\"title\":\"About Gorou\",\"desc\":\"Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird.\"},{\"title\":\"About Kuki Shinobu\",\"desc\":\"Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sayu\",\"desc\":\"All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Itto: I\",\"desc\":\"I know what you're thinking: \\\"I don't see it — how did this guy get to become the boss of the Arataki Gang on the back of beetle fighting and trading card games?\\\" Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Itto: II\",\"desc\":\"People in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: \\\"Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!\\\" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Itto: III\",\"desc\":\"In a... \\\"attempt\\\"... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Itto: IV\",\"desc\":\"In the Arataki Gang, we're proud to welcome people who've experienced adversity in their lives. Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together — both the highs and the lows.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Itto: V\",\"desc\":\"I gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!\"},{\"title\":\"Itto's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Beetle fighting, trading card games, spinning tops, kendama, hide-and-seek, you name it, I can play it! Whaddya say, pick one and we'll have a little contest? Just make sure you're ready to get thrashed! Hahaha!\"},{\"title\":\"Itto's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"Granny Oni isn't an oni at all... In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in. If people have got a problem with me, fine, I don't care what other people think anyway... *sigh* But I wish people wouldn't go after her because of me.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Lollipops are pretty much the best things ever. The candy tastes awesome, but also, it looks really cool just having a stick hanging out of your mouth. It gives me, like... a real punk kind of vibe. Here, you try it!\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Uh, well I am an oni! So there's nothing I hate more than beans. Soybeans, Mung Beans, whatever, I hate 'em all. Just touching one is enough to set off my allergies, let alone eating them. We have to get people to resist this constant urge to throw beans everywhere!\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Today's an important day. I had to send the gang away, otherwise they'd be accusing me of favoritism. Here, take a look at this. I got you the greatest birthday gift combo ever! One top-grade Onikabuto — I'll have you know it took me three whole days and nights to catch this bad boy — one out-of-print collectible trading card that took me 300 rounds to get my hands on, and finally, a birthday song performance performed personally by yours truly! Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Biiiirthday dear Traveler, Happy Birthday to youuuu!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Now that's what I'm talking about, baby! Woo-haha! Better look out, I'm way stronger now!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Ah yeah, this is gonna do wonders for my win ratio!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Feel the power, baby! Wanna see me smash a boulder?\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"I think \\\"Numero Uno\\\" just went from nickname to reality, boom! Haha! Hey, but just because I made it to the top doesn't mean I'm gonna forget all the things you've done for me, okay? I've still got your back, anytime, anywhere.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Let's roll!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Haha!

Or so Mona will insist.<br/>Teyvat is a place where people of all sorts go about their business, and even an enigmatic astrologist must look to hers.<br/>—That said, it seems like bards might be the exception to this rule.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Recently, Mona's teacher, an old but highly skilled female astrologist, has entrusted a very important task to her.<br/>Her teacher has an erstwhile rival-friend in Mondstadt, and she wanted Mona to retrieve a highly confidential box from that person's successor.<br/>\\\"If you dare look inside that books... Well, you'll see.\\\"<br/>That was the warning Mona received before departing.<br/>To Mona's surprise, this successor was none other than the Spark Knight, Klee.<br/>The box was still extant, but due to Klee's actions and a series of accidents... Mona unwittingly unraveled the enigma behind the box.<br/>\\\"I—I'm done for. The thing inside this was the dark history of her youth... she will kill me if I go back like this...\\\"<br/>Mona was thus forced to stay in Mondstadt, beginning a bitterly frugal but bountifully fulfilling existence.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Mona's astrology utilizes hydromancy, and she once explained the underlying principles thusly:<br/>\\\"It is people's fate that shines in the night sky, and though its reflection in water is but an illusion, it reveals the truth nonetheless.\\\"<br/>No one else can quite comprehend this principle, but Mona's ability convinces people to believe in it anyway.<br/>Albeit, sometimes grudgingly...<br/>Her astrological readings are exceptionally precise, and she will neither lie nor hold anything back when revealing the results of her readings.<br/>\\\"Your son says that he's made it. That's a lie.\\\"<br/>\\\"You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you.\\\"<br/>The cold, hard truth is laid bare before people' eyes, complete with all the grisly details that they would rather remained buried.<br/>Mona will make no exceptions to this, and as such she can seem completely lacking in human emotion.<br/>But sometimes, on a clear night, she can be seen on a high mountain slope.<br/>There, Mona gazes up at the stars in the sky — so close, she feels, that she could almost reach out and touch them — with gentle eyes, humming an unknown tune to herself.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Having never studied the art of finance, the astrologist Mona is always hovering around the poverty line.<br/>In order to save on food expenses, she once ate mushrooms for an entire month straight. If not for some relief funds coming from time to time, she would have had trouble eking out a living.<br/>Mona does in fact have some money set aside. Even though she must eventually run dry without an income, she can slow the bleeding by scrimping in the food department.<br/>So where does the rest of the Mora go? Well, if you've ever had a look inside her lab, then know that the big pile of astrology-related apparatus and tools in there didn't come out of thin air.<br/>In fact, all of them come with a hefty price tag — books from Liyue, an astrolabe from Sumeru... The shipping fees alone are impressive.<br/>That Mona should be in abject poverty comes, therefore, as no surprise.<br/>In order to support herself, Mona eventually took up a commercial contract — her contributions to a column about constellation in The Steambird have become her most stable income source.<br/>Now having a monthly income, Mona could have left her life of poverty. But how could an astrologist's pursuit of knowledge end here?<br/>Whenever she gets paid, Mona will immediately shell out on more astrology-related resources, returning to a state of destitution once more.<br/>This process plays out every month.<br/>Today, too, is another day Mona worries over Mora.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Mona will sometimes meet up with Klee and Albedo, her primary reason being to get a free meal.<br/>Secondary to that is to exchange pointers with Albedo.<br/>Since they are both people who seek to unveil the principles of the world, and both are accomplished students of famed masters, aligning themselves with one another and working together is perfectly normal.<br/>Mona staunchly defends her teacher's image in front of Albedo.<br/>However, she also often complains about \\\"that old hag.\\\"<br/>\\\"You speak of your illustrious lineage, yet you also refer to your master as a \\\"hag\\\" and a \\\"stubborn dimwit.\\\" Which of these descriptions is accurate?\\\"<br/>Albedo could not help but ask this question — and when he did, Mona promptly realized that she had never given it much thought herself.<br/>Stroking her chin, she pondered this paradox deeply for a moment, before responding:<br/>\\\"Hmph. The techniques passed down to me are exceptional, of course, but my teacher is not my equal.<br/>Does she know the market rates for eggs, butter, or wheat? In this regard, I have already far surpassed her.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"During her apprenticeship, Mona found that the subtle abstractions of her master's teachings could explain the laws that governed the existence of all things.<br/>Human hearts were guided by these laws, and if one had great enough powers of calculation, all the mysteries of the world could be understood.<br/>Mona once believed this to be true.<br/>But when she had to strike out on her own and live day-to-day, she found herself doubting.<br/>Not everyone lived wealthy and comfortable lives. Some neither had food nor warm clothes, living no differently from beggars.<br/>And it was just such an adventurer who, when meeting Mona while she was out looking for fruits and vegetables to fill her stomach, shared half their food with her.<br/>\\\"Out here, we've gotta have each other's backs.\\\"<br/>This was not something inscribed on these so-called principles of the world. And many other such things she encountered on her journey — the honesty of a thief, a robber's change of heart, a coward's courage, the good deeds of a wicked person...<br/>Mona began to have some doubts, but she also felt like she finally had her feet on solid ground.<br/>When she was again alone with her thoughts under the stars, she marveled that her research had been so full of holes.<br/>Perhaps she would have to continue researching the world's principles for the rest of her life.\"},{\"title\":\"All Things Astrological\",\"desc\":\"The Court of Fontaine's mainline newspaper, The Steambird, has many a featured section that contains all sorts of news and gossip drawn from every corner of the seven nations.<br/>The section Mona contributes to is known as \\\"All Things Astrological,\\\" and it is a column specifically targeted at hobbyists and professionals. That she had this opportunity at all was pure chance.<br/>When the previous contributing author was traveling the world, he heard tell of a strange astrologist, and his hobbyist's curiosity compelled him to seek her out.<br/>Their correspondence left him deeply impressed.<br/>As it happened, he was also looking to retire, and seeing that Mona was strapped for Mora, reached out to help her by recommending her to the editor-in-chief of The Steambird.<br/>When Mona released her first column, \\\"An Introduction to Astrology,\\\" the column, heretofore known for being easy reading, experienced a massive shift in tone.<br/>Most of each issue was dedicated to discussing the movement of celestial bodies and other difficult (and obscure) topics. Academic quotations, dense footnotes and even the occasional hand-drawn star maps abounded in these writings.<br/>The editor-in-chief could not help but feel worried that this approach was too academic. Would it find acceptance with long-time readers? As it turned out, there was no need to fret. The publishing house received a great many letters that read something like this:<br/>\\\"Wow, this is amazing. I don't really get it, but this is super interesting. Consider me a fan of Astrologist Mona Megistus.\\\"<br/>After getting approval to continue submitting manuscripts, Mona could finally heave a sigh of relief.<br/>Now, how best to celebrate... Ah yes. Perhaps she should use her first paycheck to purchase that latest-edition planetarium she'd had her eye on for a while now...\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"To Mona, that her Vision was sent to her from the gods doesn't mean a great deal.<br/>This is not to say that possessing an external focus for elemental power is not useful.<br/>Having power is always a good thing, but when compared to lofty \\\"truth,\\\" \\\"martial prowess\\\" is such a pathetically small concept.<br/>The gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world. Mona seeks the final truth of the world, hidden amidst the sea of stars.<br/>As such, she does not have any reverence for her Vision, which the people of this world consider to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power.<br/>Nonetheless, this item that serves no practical use in her hands is something that she treasures greatly.<br/>It was gifted to her by her teacher as a teaching aid, and it is the only evidence of their time together as master and pupil.<br/>She preserves these distant memories with great care. This exquisitely-made teaching aid thus accompanied her everywhere, like an accessory worn by any other maiden.<br/>Until one day, when a Vision of her very own would quietly indwell this old teaching aid...\"}]}\n",

It is, after all, the one useful study tool that miserly old lady ever gave me, in a rare act of generosity.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share\",\"desc\":\"Do you know about constellations? Astrologers believe that the patterns of the stars map out the destinies of Vision bearers — past, present, and future, everything is written in the stars.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"This... travel companion of yours — do you know anything of her origins? No matter what, I cannot seem to discern a single shred of information regarding this floating fairy's fate. ...Oh? So you don't know where she comes from, either?\"},{\"title\":\"About Jean\",\"desc\":\"You mean the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? Her constellation is Leo Minor, which represents strength and responsibility shouldered too young... Though the lioness has been separated from her pride for a long time, she grows from strength to strength, and the day will come when she is ready to return as its glorious leader.\"},{\"title\":\"About Albedo\",\"desc\":\"Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself...\"},{\"title\":\"About Klee\",\"desc\":\"Ah yes, Alice's daughter. She's in the custody of the Knights of Favonius, and Albedo looks after her too. She's blessed to have Trifolium as her constellation, which represents good luck. I'm slightly envious... *smirk* Although, if I'd been blessed with good luck, I suppose I never would have had the great honor of running into that old woman, would I...\"},{\"title\":\"About Diluc\",\"desc\":\"Diluc Ragnvindr. His constellation, Noctua, represents vigilance in the darkness of night... A lone guardian keeping watch, longing for the splendor of dawn, yet destined to solitude in the dark days preceding its arrival.<br/>...Or, wait, maybe Noctua's the one tied to wealth...?\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaeya\",\"desc\":\"Kaeya Alberich? He's a Pavo Ocellus. Destined for greatness and grandeur... and to hide ugly realities behind a layer of charm and elegance. He believes he has made a clean break with his past, but one day fate will catch up with him. When it does, he will have a major decision to make.\"},{\"title\":\"About Lisa\",\"desc\":\"A Tempus Fugit... The constellation derives its name from the hourglass, and stands for knowledge and time — or rather, the trade-off between them. As each grain of sand falls down, a moment of time — of life, even, dies for good. To stop the unrelenting flow of sand, one would have to turn the hourglass on its side. But once the sand comes to rest, it remains motionless forever... Hmm, maybe 'becomes lazy' is more accurate than 'comes to rest,' in this case.\"},{\"title\":\"About Venti\",\"desc\":\"Venti? The bard that sits around doing nothing all day? What's so interesting about him? Sure, I guess I can take a look... Huh, that's weird, the scryglass, it's... I can't see a thing... this wind... I can't... open my eyes! No, my hat! Ah! My clothes, stop! The wind's going to strip all my clothes off! Make it stop, make it stop! ...Alright, alright! I'll never do this again!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Mona: I\",\"desc\":\"You want to chat... for fun? Oh... I don't usually have spare time for such activities, especially when I have so many columns left to write... Then again, since it's you, it might be worth it. Hehe, a change of pace once in a while isn't such a bad thing.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Mona: II\",\"desc\":\"Income? From astrology...? You can't use... things like Mora to determine the value of astrology! You need to understand: hydromancy is the one and only means of discerning people's true destiny in the whole of Teyvat! No matter how much Mora or gems you might have, the value of fate is quite simply incalculable! Perhaps not the smartest question you might have had for me...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Mona: III\",\"desc\":\"You want me to explain how astrology works? I'm not sure you'd understand even if I told you. But since you ask... The method I use is called hydromancy. The art of inferring fate from the illusory reflection of the stars on the water's surface. The inverted reflection in the water is an image of the heavens from within which the truth of our world can be observed. ...It is the one and only success story of that old lady's research endeavors.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Mona: IV\",\"desc\":\"Mona Megistus, the Astrologist — we came up with that name together, the old lady and me. She said it had a nice ring to it... But then she started calling me 'Meg' for short, which I hate, because obviously 'Mona' is already sufficient for a shorter name— No! You are NOT allowed to call me that, it's embarrassing! Gah! I knew I shouldn't have told you!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Mona: V\",\"desc\":\"The golden rule all fortune-tellers abide by is: never offer advice. Only state the results of the divination. Otherwise, you risk your fate becoming tangled up with that of your subject. But for you, I will make an exception to this rule — because our fates have been intertwined from the beginning.\"},{\"title\":\"Mona's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My hobby? Stargazing! In this all-too-real world in which we live, we all need to look up from the dust once in a while and fix our gaze on the stars, in a spirit of wonder... That, plus the whole thing about me being an astrologer.\"},{\"title\":\"Mona's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"*sigh* The equipment repair bill is due, and so is the final payment for that celestial globe I ordered... Also, I still need to renew my journal subscriptions, not to mention pay the rent... Hmm, which one to prioritize? ...Ah, I'll pay off the celestial globe first. If I leave it any longer, they'll sell out, and then I'll never get my hands on one...\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Salad. Salad is by far the best food in the world. Cheap to buy, easy to whip up, filling, and it's the most convenient thing there is when you're working on a column or fixing some equipment — I mean, who's got time for a proper dinner anyway?\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"You know, all those... overpriced, fancy foods. Personally, I think it's uncivilized and, frankly, dangerous to splash out and indulge yourself every time you have a little hunger pang.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy Birthday. Here's my gift to you — it's a bag containing some words of advice that may help you through tough patches. ...No, don't open it yet. During the year ahead, this bag will open itself when the right time comes.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"This was ordained by fate!

She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the guild master.<br/>Then again, would they really have had to do much persuading?

A long time ago in a place far, far away, there was a tiny little girl.<br/>The girl's parents were busy adventurers. She spent most of her childhood in the library, traversing the countless universes that were contained in the pages of the library books.<br/>She became the ruler of the Immernachtreich, summoned Thundering Retribution as a royal princess, and formed a soul bond with a Raven...<br/>...<br/>\\\"███, what books did you read today?\\\" Her parents asked her on one of the rare occasions that they were home between adventures.<br/>She proceeded to tell them the story she had read from her favorite series.<br/>\\\"...And then he said, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, you are the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.'\\\"<br/>\\\"Oh, that's a lovely story. Since you like it so much, ███, how about I call you \\\"Fischl\\\" too?\\\" Her father smiled, put his hand on her head and repeated the words from the story to her.<br/>\\\"Fischl, you are my wonderful princess and my proud daughter. You shall never surrender your nobility and dreams.\\\"<br/>These kind and loving words lit up her world.<br/>However, the time with her busy parents was always fleeting.<br/>Unable to fit in with her peers due to her obsession with fantasy novels, she often felt lonely and sad. At these times, she would remind herself:<br/>\\\"I am Fischl, my daddy's wonderful princess. It's true, because Mommy and Daddy said so...\\\"<br/>\\\"Never will I surrender my nobility and dreams, for they are... a princess' rite of passage.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Just like in the universe of \\\"Flowers for Princess Fischl,\\\" entropy begot destruction.<br/>In other words: The girl who loved to dream grew up.<br/>On her fourteenth birthday, those of her peers who refused to accommodate her quirks belittled her once again.<br/>\\\"This is but a minor setback for the noble princess. My parents will understand,\\\" she thought to herself.<br/>For if she knew one thing, it was that as a princess she could never surrender her nobility and dreams.<br/>But when she threw herself into her parents' arms in need of comfort, she was met instead with gentle words of exasperation.<br/>\\\"███, you are fourteen years old now. It's fun to make-believe, but eventually you need to grow up and put your childish dreams behind you...\\\"<br/>And with that, the same voice that had once lit up her world now tore it apart.<br/>That day at midnight, she hid herself in the library she knew so well. She had a strange feeling that she was being watched... Suddenly, she heard an otherworldly flapping of wings.<br/>Sure enough, she looked up and her red, swollen eyes met with those of a night raven from another world.<br/>What transpired afterwards is another story...<br/>Fischl doesn't much like this story. Thinking about it causes her to feel suffocating pain and soul-devouring loneliness.<br/>Maybe one day, this story will be written. But that would be ███'s story, not Fischl's.<br/>Fischl has but one identity: she's the Prinzessin.<br/>As long as she remembers this simple and perfect logic, with a little bit of nobility and a touch of kindness from others, nothing can ever hurt her.<br/>Things are looking up for Prinzessin Fischl these days — not only does she have Oz, but she has finally met a traveler who, just like her, comes from a different world...\"},{\"title\":\"Flowers for Princess Fischl: Phantasmagoria\",\"desc\":\"The novel series \\\"Flowers for Princess Fischl\\\" is available as a collectible set.<br/>Due the tiny numbers in circulation, it is a priceless commodity amongst loyal fans of the author.<br/>But no matter how elegant these works are aesthetically, their worldview remains incredibly bleak:<br/>Every good, bright and noble thing must eventually fall to inexorable entropic destruction, and the final destination of the universe is the realm-in-waiting of the Prinzessin, Immernachtreich.<br/>This is the fate of all worlds, of the universe, and all who live in it.<br/>And the Prinzessin and her loyal companion, the \\\"Night-Severing Raven Oz,\\\" Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, are the World Beasts who will swallow all dreams.<br/>At the very end, at the end of karma itself, she will grant all the gathered souls her benediction, and use her Thundering Retribution to cleanse all that is ugly and wicked.<br/>The Prinzessin will then set her own heart ablaze, and the universe shall be born anew in its immortal light.<br/>But before all this can come to pass, the Prinzessin must first roam many universes, and see countless new sights.<br/>Thus it is perfectly within the spirit of the original work that the Prinzessin should be stuck as an investigator for the Adventurers' Guild in a slightly backward world. Just a little twist of fate, nothing more.<br/>The Prinzessin will come to understand someday that each moment of her life, no matter how insignificant their little twists could be, is to be treasured.<br/>After all, the Prinzessin's very own Phantasmagoria is made out of ones such as these.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"So, is Oz just an imaginary friend who only exists as a figment of Fischl's subconscious?<br/>Our story begins with the royal heirloom, Edelstein der Dunkelheit — that is to say, Fischl's Vision.<br/>When her wish was acknowledged, the raven Oz and her Vision both appeared before her eyes.<br/>That night, at dinner, Oz got on most well with Fischl's parents:<br/>\\\"Ah, mein Kaiser und Kaiserin der Verurteilung, forgive mine overstep, but the beans in your house are too delicious.\\\"<br/>\\\"Oh, then please, help yourself.

However, Xingqiu possesses a unique scholarly talent among his peers — that is, the offspring of Liyue's wealthiest merchants — and was often praised by his tutors as a young student.<br/>Xingqiu's elder brother, while he was learning the family business from their father, firmly believed that Xingqiu would become a great asset to the business one day.<br/>However, little did he know that Xingqiu, after finishing the dauntingly thick volumes on commerce and philosophy, would hollow them out and sneak martial art novels into them, which he read incessantly thereafter.<br/>Sometimes, Xingqiu suddenly disappears for hours at a time with no explanation. When asked why, he simply replies: \\\"A moment of solitude.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"To Xingqiu, \\\"a moment of solitude\\\" can mean all sorts of things.<br/>Examples include visiting Wanwen Bookhouse to peruse the latest novels and going to Heyu Tea House to sample Yun Jin's latest drink.<br/>Sometimes, it means that he is off to fight for justice in the name of chivalry.<br/>Defeating bandits on the road, driving away monsters, helping distressed children by fetching their kites from the tree tops... there are all manner of responsibilities that fall into the category of chivalry.<br/>Inspired by tropes from his beloved martial arts novels — such as the king who wears a disguise and mingles with the common folk — Xingqiu does not hesitate to leverage the power of the Feiyun Commerce Guild to resolve more complex issues when violence isn't the answer.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"One day, Xingqiu's older brother came looking for him, only to find he wasn't around. When Xingqiu later returned, he came across his brother in the hallway.<br/>\\\"Your room was a mess, so I cleaned it up. Listen, both you and I are responsible for the reputation of Feiyun Commerce Guild. We have to act the part. If you can't clean up a room, how will you clean up the world? An adeptus once said...\\\"<br/>After half an hour of lecturing, Xingqiu was finally let go, but his brother said something strange at the end:<br/>\\\"I'll not enter your room without permission next time... I'll make sure the maids do the same.\\\"<br/>Xingqiu had no idea what he was talking about. However, as his brother turned away, with a despondent look upon his face, he muttered to himself:<br/>\\\"Those books under his bed... No. No, I shouldn't go looking at what kind of books they are... Xingqiu is growing up after all... Don't want to be lecturing him all the time... Puberty perhaps?\\\"<br/>Afterwards, even Xingqiu found it odd. Expecting that one of the maids would have something to say about the stash of martial arts novels under his bed, he had long since prepared his response, but in the end, no one ever bothered to check his room again.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"To keep Xingqiu from spending his whole day at Wanwen Bookhouse in Feiyun Slope, his father agreed to let him learn martial arts from the Guhua Clan. Much to his dismay, Xingqiu quickly discovered that Guhua was a dying art that had been in constant decline for years. There was no proper tuition and it turned out the luxury dojo he had signed up in didn't even belong to the clan — they had just rented it temporarily to keep up appearances.<br/>Xingqiu's father was, of course, fully aware of this state of affairs in advance. To him, the whole thing was just for fun; he thought Xingqiu would be content to learn a spot of bladework for show, not for serious self-defense.<br/>He hadn't counted on the prodigiously intelligent and extremely well-read Xingqiu being as outstanding a talent in Guhua as he was in every other discipline he had turned his hand to. A combination of his own intuition and extensive knowledge of ancient literature meant he was able to completely revitalize the dead art.<br/>Xingqiu was disappointed by Guhua's martial arts program at the beginning, but he found the other tricks they taught to be exactly what he had hoped for.<br/>Quicklime, smoking sand, paper fish, sword-swallowing, fire-breathing... Xingqiu was spoilt for choice.<br/>He decided on the spot that he would learn them all, no matter how long it would take him. He reasoned that they would be useful to have in his repertoire during his future exploits as a chivalrous hero.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"There are two sides to the swashbuckling Xingqiu's personality. While quiet and unassuming in front of strangers, he is gregarious and chatty in the company of close friends and family. Though more restrained than his elder brother, he even has a playful and mischievous side.<br/>The one who usually bears the brunt of his bizarre sense of humor is someone named Chongyun, an exorcist usually found on one of the forest trails around Liyue.<br/>\\\"Chongyun... I found a haunted house for you to practice in...\\\"<br/>\\\"Chongyun, you have to believe me... It wasn't me who laid the traps inside that haunted house— What? It's not haunted? Well... I, uh, couldn't have known that, could I?\\\"<br/>\\\"Chongyun... Don't glare at me like that... Look, you're injured. You'd better just lie there and get some rest.\\\"<br/>\\\"Tell you what, Chongyun, we have a maid who learned the art of essential oil therapy in a nobleman's house in Sumeru... How about I ask her to tend to your wounds? You owe me for this, though...\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The notion of chivalry means different things to different people.<br/>Chivalry means listening to your conscience calling you to action when you see an injustice, right? Or is chivalry simply about knowing right from wrong? No, that's not enough — it must have something to do with being a righteous person...<br/>To Xingqiu, chivalry simply means: Be good, and do good.<br/>As a son of a wealthy merchant in Liyue Harbor, he was born to ride the waves in the world of trade. Notions of chivalry should have gradually left him as he grew up.<br/>However, obtaining a Vision changed everything — it meant he was finally able accomplish those legendary deeds he could only dream of as a child.<br/>Of course, there is no way he can completely divest himself of his duties in the Guild, but so long as he gets to go out and be the hero even occasionally, he is perfectly content with his life.<br/>The only thing that can wipe the smile from Xingqiu's face is when cynics question the true motives of chivalrous heroes.<br/>Rank, reputation, reward, shadowy deals... Whenever Xingqiu hears people smearing the names of true heroes, the expression on his face may not change, but he will be sure to add that person to the special section of his blacklist reserved for people he despises even more than carrots.\"},{\"title\":\"\\\"A Legend of Sword\\\"\",\"desc\":\"Xingqiu once wrote a martial arts novel named \\\"A Legend of Sword\\\" based on his own experiences, intending to publish it in Liyue Harbor.<br/>To his surprise, his manuscript was rejected by local publishing houses, who believed that no one would have any interest in a story with \\\"a setting as wildly unrealistic as the plot is banal.\\\"<br/>Undeterred, Xingqiu had a few copies printed privately, and sneakily placed them on the shelves of Wanwen Bookhouse during one of his many trips there. But just as the publishers had suspected, it failed to garner much interest from readers. This was quite a blow to Xingqiu's confidence.<br/>Unbeknownst to him, however, a passing merchant from Inazuma did purchase a copy to bring home, where it received rave reviews. Writers the region over attempted to copy the success of \\\"A Legend of Sword,\\\" but none succeeded — it maintains permanent residency in the number one bestseller spot to this day.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"The martial arts school known as the Guhua Clan has been in decline for several hundred years now. In its heyday, the name of the Clan rang like steel throughout the harbor. It was said that the Clan harbored three great secret arts — the ways of the \\\"Light Piercer\\\" for polearms, \\\"Rain Cutter\\\" for swords, and \\\"Life Ender\\\" for those who excelled in both. The three arts would be refined over the generations, and with time would reach their apex. Yet the Clan's strength would continue to wane, leading to them losing their influence... The three arts became diamonds hidden in the rough, quietly awaiting a successor.<br/>After many years, the Guhua Clan would finally get one in Xingqiu. It was he who successfully grasped the ancient \\\"Martial Principle\\\" after merely four years of study.<br/>The Guhua weapon arts stress using the weapon as an extension of your body, and indeed this is a common idea amongst the various schools of martial arts in Liyue. But the way Xingqiu saw it, the basis of the polearm and sword was the use of a Vision. Martial artists were meant to see a Vision as an extension of themselves, and see their weapon as an extension of the Vision. Hence, he says that: the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the \\\"eye.\\\" <br/>Having come to this epiphany, Xingqiu took up a quill and penned a verse on the Martial Principle. Reading it, the Guhua head was shaken with tears, declaring that \\\"it is not Xingqiu who needs the Guhua Clan, but the Guhua Clan that needs Xingqiu.\\\" Since then, this verse has been sealed up at the Clan headquarters at Wangshan Hall. Disciples are proscribed from reading it, much less outsiders.<br/>The verse reads thus:<br/>Guhua's arts I have studied long, in its secrets I am trained, now its long-lost depths fall upon me like the coming of blessed rain.<br/>The beating heart of Guhua's sword art is as a shower of floating flowers. One amidst may seize a bloom, but those without read only doom.<br/>The Guhua lance is a lantern's dance, like flames in night's deep glooming. Like sparks, they scatter with ease in the dark, then join like the daybreak looming.<br/>They say the sword is as your arm — I say its glint is the beholder's eye, a light like the bright dawn coming.<br/>Those who wander are burdened not. Freely they cut rain, and enlightened they pierce light. Like a snaking dragon, they cannot be subdued. In their right eye the blade, and in the other the spear.<br/>This text should have been free for all to read. The only reason why it was sealed is the dreadful handwriting.\"}]}\n",

If there's anything that you need, Noelle is glad to be of aid.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Noelle is \\\"the maid of all maids\\\" to many.<br/>Such people also tend to say this of her: \\\"She's everywhere.\\\"<br/>For example, there was a child who once tried to get a plate during a banquet, but found that there was no way to open the cabinet without all the plates falling out...<br/>\\\"Noelle!!!!!!\\\"<br/>All the child needed to do was scream, and Noelle appeared. She put the cabinet down on its back, took a plate out, and handed it to the child, reminding him not to have cold drinks immediately after having barbecue. Then she righted the cabinet, cleaned up other plates, and then put them back in order.<br/>Noelle's ability to be everywhere all at once is something miraculous to many.<br/>However, the job of a maid is no myth or legend. Noelle only does her job to the letter.<br/>\\\"No more, no less. As it should be, not as it should not be.\\\"<br/>Noelle doesn't think herself special, only that she thinks too much at times.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Noelle is always eager to help, sometimes excessively so.<br/>If you were to ask her how to build a campfire as she passed by, she would not only stop and build the campfire for you, she would also put up the grill racks, season the food, cook it for you, taste it herself to make sure it's done, and remind you to put out the fire when you've finished so as not to burn the forest down. Then she would get back to whatever she had been doing beforehand.<br/>Of course, most people don't mind at all that she regularly goes the extra mile. But it can sometimes produce unexpected results...<br/>For example, a merchant from Snezhnaya once came to Mondstadt, ostensibly wishing to get into the winery business. In truth, he had an evil plot to ruin the land, destroy the winery business in Mondstadt altogether and then seize the market with wines from Snezhnaya.<br/>He disguised himself as an honest merchant with his family on a business trip to Mondstadt. Naturally, with them being visitors from afar, Noelle gave them a warm reception.<br/>Initially, the merchant was delighted with Noelle's hospitality; it was a cut above the crude etiquette he had come to expect from most peasants in Mondstadt. However, after a while he began to feel that something was amiss.<br/>Noelle seemed to be able to read his mind: She correctly guessed his schedule, cooked his family's favorite Snezhnayan dishes for them each day, and even knew that his daughter liked to go to bed hugging a ragdoll, presenting her with a hand-made doll she had sewn together herself.<br/>This spooked the merchant, and made him hesitant to execute the next phase of his plan. Noelle's warm smile now chilled the merchant to the bone. What else did she know, and what was she really planning?<br/>In the end, the merchant fled Mondstadt with his family.<br/>Noelle was upset for a few days, thinking she had somehow insulted her guests. Little did she know that all of Mondstadt was indebted to her for taking her job so seriously.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Most of the time, Noelle's reliability provides a comforting presence, but there are always exceptions.<br/>Once, she learned that an adventurer was trapped on Dragonspine, so she decided to mount a rescue by herself.<br/>The snowstorm that day was terribly fierce, wiping out any tracks left by humans as soon as they were made. It was impossible to find a safe route to proceed, to say nothing of saving the adventurer amidst the snow.<br/>However, Noelle persisted on searching for the adventurer and eventually found him inside a cave, suffering from severe hypothermia.<br/>At the time, her coat was completely soaked, and the water inside her bottle had turned to ice. Thirsty and hungry, Noelle still managed to carry the adventurer down on her back.<br/>The adventurer was saved, but Noelle, having over-exerted herself, laid in bed for three days straight, suffering from a high fever. Everyone in the Knights of Favonius barely slept out of concern for her during that period. Fortunately, Noelle recovered.<br/>It was not the first or second time that something similar had happened, and everyone was deeply worried for Noelle.<br/>In order to prevent Noelle from putting herself in harm's way again, Jean had to invent some safe jobs to keep Noelle busy. If something were to happen, then Kaeya would have to save the day.<br/>During the Stormterror threat, Noelle was also eager to resolve the threat at its source. However, Kaeya managed to arrange quite a few \\\"urgent matters\\\" for her to attend to inside the city until it was all over.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Noelle's petite form does a good job of hiding her great strength.<br/>This does not just refer to her resoluteness or her indomitable spirit, but also her physical strength.<br/>Once, Lisa accidentally dropped her experimental apparatus under her bookshelf and troubled over whether she could remain decent while bending over to retrieve it. Noelle made it over in the nick of time, lifting the full bookshelf with only one hand — and not a single book fell out between her hefting it and putting it down.<br/>There was another incident in which several cargo-bearing carts were attacked by Pyro Slimes as they tried to pass through Mondstadt's side gate. As the owners were all in a panic, it was Noelle again who came to the rescue — hurling the carts — cargo and all, into the Cider Lake, before leaping into the water herself and retrieving every last item.<br/>Rumor has it that when Noelle was studying the blade, she nearly sent Wagner — who prided himself in his forging skills — into despairing seclusion.<br/>In all, he forged over ten different swords with different alloy compositions for Noelle, but all would lose their edge after a few uses.<br/>At first, Wagner thought Noelle unskilled, but eventually found that the problem was more foundational: the swords just weren't strong enough.<br/>Putting his reputation on the line, Wagner finally made Noelle a sturdy and heavy claymore that was further reinforced by her affinity for Geo. Only then was her weapon issue (barely) solved.<br/>But don't worry, Noelle won't use her superhuman strength unless the situation calls for it, as she is a pacifist at heart.<br/>They say, however, that the very day Noelle received her custom-made claymore, she was set upon by a pair of drunken Treasure Hoarders in Drunkard Gorge, who thought her a harmless lamb...<br/>Let's just hope that no one else will ever be so unlucky.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Noelle's greatest enemy, curiously, is not a person, but Ludi Harpastum itself.<br/>During Ludi Harpastum, long tables arranged in a circular shape and filled with all kinds of food will be set up in the plaza before the Cathedral for everyone to enjoy.<br/>The food is usually prepared by volunteers who can cook. During this time, Noelle, who always holds herself to a high standard, joins the volunteers in continuously cooking and serving food.<br/>It's not really any additional work; what's difficult is that she insists on tasting every dish to make sure they are up to standard.<br/>The crispy Moon Pies; the sizzling Mondstadt Pork Chops; the towering Pile 'Em Ups — all the fried and barbecued foods, equal parts delicious and fatty, are customary at the festival.<br/>The smiles on people's faces make Noelle truly happy. What makes her less so is seeing her bulging belly. She can't help but let out a sigh.<br/>For the entire month following the festival, Noelle will volunteer for the Knights of Favonius' city night patrol.<br/>The festival may be over, but her battle is only beginning.\"},{\"title\":\"\\\"Warning of Roses\\\"\",\"desc\":\"The maids of the Knights have many \\\"red lines\\\" that are not to be crossed, and one of these is that \\\"the personal information of the Knights must be kept in strict confidence.\\\"<br/>This does not only require restricting outsider access to such information — this restriction also applies to other members of the Knights.<br/>For example, what Jean keeps in her private quarters, the contents of Amber's Baron Bunny, the number of special eye patches that Kaeya owns, the number of Klee's hidden bomb caches... These things are all top secret.<br/>To avoid leaking such information, Noelle used red cloth to make a great many roses — in Mondstadt, this flower means \\\"my lips are sealed.\\\"<br/>She specially wove one such rose into her gauntlet as an ever-present reminder to herself.<br/>Revealing secrets would be a major dereliction of duty for a maid, and those who aspire to be knights cannot afford such errors.<br/>So you can forget about probing Noelle for any secrets. She won't tell.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Noelle did once wish to fulfill her dream before its time. Some years ago, after failing her seventh selection test, which was really a foregone conclusion, she felt somewhat discouraged.<br/>The etiquette, swordsmanship, the lines she had memorized... had they all gone to waste? She remembered all the strong points of every official knight, but who would remember the hard work of a failure like her?<br/>She had never stopped aspiring to become a Knight of Favonius, but her exhausted body wouldn't let her get back on her feet like she normally would. She felt like someone who had spent days and nights traveling through an icy tundra.<br/>At that moment, the main gate of the Knights Headquarters were flung upon, and out walked Acting Grand Master Jean, who had just been in charge of the selection process.<br/>Without a thought, Noelle gave a precise knight's salute.<br/>Immediately, she knew that this was too abrupt a thing to do, and wondered what Jean might think of her.<br/>But just as she was wishing that there was some hole she might crawl into to flee, Jean stopped in her own tracks and returned the salute.<br/>After a moment's surprise, Noelle gave a strained smile, clumsy but pure.<br/>This was a lucky day that she would always remember, for she would receive recognition from two all-important sources this day: once from Jean, and the other from the gods.<br/>Her hard work had been remembered after all.<br/>From that day forward, Vision in hand, Noelle reaffirmed her belief that she would one day be able to don that armor. That she would be gentle and reliable — and yes, everywhere at once too.\"}]}\n",

I didn't quite catch your request...\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Rest\",\"desc\":\"You seem tired. Would you like some tea? I'll brew you some. Do you take sugar? One cube, or two?\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Being Reliable\",\"desc\":\"Whenever you need me, I'll be there.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Rains\",\"desc\":\"Oh dear, everyone's laundry is still on the line! May I be excused to fetch it in?\"},{\"title\":\"When Thunder Strikes\",\"desc\":\"Please stay indoors until the storm passes. I will deal with any urgent outdoor business.\"},{\"title\":\"When the Sun Is Out\",\"desc\":\"Mmm, such fair weather. Why don't we do a bit of sunny work? Oh, what sort of work is that, you ask? Haha, well, anything that makes you feel bright and sunny too.\"},{\"title\":\"When It's Windy\",\"desc\":\"Ahh... Can you hear the Anemo Archon's voice on the breeze? It calms me down whenever I get flustered.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Morning\",\"desc\":\"Good morning! Breakfast is served. I will be on hand the whole time. Should you find that anything is not to your taste, please, do not hesitate to let me know.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Ready for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Lighter-Than-Air Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"Everyone has free time in the evening, and that is when I am busiest. Where have Amber's washed hairbands been placed? How many new eyepatches did Kaeya buy? Keeping track of all these things is a maid's responsibility.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"Please get some rest, you must be tired from today's adventure. I should head back to the Knights of F— Sorry? You want me to watch over you until you fall asleep? I—I... I mean, of course, it's no problem. But, um... You're not just teasing me, are you?\"},{\"title\":\"About Noelle: Discipline\",\"desc\":\"In my job, I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately, this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.\"},{\"title\":\"About Noelle: Disagreement\",\"desc\":\"I'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Identities\",\"desc\":\"I am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake — I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Reminders\",\"desc\":\"Even when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables. Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, \\\"that's too much trouble, I'll just leave it to Noelle,\\\" are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Welcome Party\",\"desc\":\"So I hear you're an Honorary Knight of Favonius? I envy you! I suppose that makes you my senior... Anyway, it's about time someone threw you a welcome party, surely? Leave it to me!\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share\",\"desc\":\"I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There've been a few times when I could've had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying, \\\"As wine bottles are corked, so too my lips are sealed.\\\" It reminds me to— What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.\"},{\"title\":\"About Amber\",\"desc\":\"I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, don't you think?\"},{\"title\":\"About Klee\",\"desc\":\"I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in solitary confinement...\"},{\"title\":\"About Jean\",\"desc\":\"Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!\"},{\"title\":\"About Varka\",\"desc\":\"At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!\"},{\"title\":\"About Kaeya\",\"desc\":\"He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, \\\"errand runner\\\"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!\"},{\"title\":\"About Bennett\",\"desc\":\"He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his \\\"dads\\\" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.\"},{\"title\":\"About Fischl: Tea\",\"desc\":\"I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.\"},{\"title\":\"About Fischl: Background\",\"desc\":\"So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Barbara\",\"desc\":\"We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Noelle: I\",\"desc\":\"How may I be of assistance? ...Oh, you just want to chat? Okay then! Well, if that's how I can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Noelle: II\",\"desc\":\"Not a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Noelle: III\",\"desc\":\"Th—These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour... Ah, okay, maybe an hour, tops. You can busy yourself with other things first, and I'll be sure to deliver them right to you, hot and fresh out of the oven!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Noelle: IV\",\"desc\":\"I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Noelle: V\",\"desc\":\"Even though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people. These days, though, I seem to be spending more and more of my time with you... It might be a bit selfish of me... What do you think?\"},{\"title\":\"Noelle's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"My hobby? I really like washing all sorts of things... clothes, floorboards, windows, you name it! Whenever I see something dirty, I just want to give it a good old clean! It gives me such a sense of achievement! ...Oh, you mean the things I do in my free time? Hmm... Same answer!\"},{\"title\":\"Noelle's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"How to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"My favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate — highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it — it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I'm not a fussy eater, but I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid, I'm expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt...\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Since you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely? Well, you need not worry about them adding up, because today, I am all yours — your exclusive maid for the entire day! Just leave it all to me! ...Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"What is this... new power!? Thank you! Now I can be of assistance to even more people.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"I cannot rest on my laurels. After all, I'm not even formally a knight yet. Until that day, I must work even harder.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Thank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot. As a maid, I should be the one serving you, but it seems you have done more for me than I could ever imagine...\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"Everyone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think— What? You think so too? Awwww... Thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Steady as stone.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"I must leave no stone unturned.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Leave it all to me.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Time to clean up.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"As a good knight should.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"As a dutiful maid would.\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"I'll catch up.\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: II\",\"desc\":\"Someone needs assistance.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"All in a day's work.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Oh, wonderful...\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"A little dusty... Best give it a spring-cleaning!\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"I can patch myself up.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"Ugh, that's going back in the wash...\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"If at first you don't succeed...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"I am a disgrace... to the knights...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: II\",\"desc\":\"But they still need me...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: III\",\"desc\":\"It was my honor to serve you...\"},{\"title\":\"Heavy Hit Taken: I\",\"desc\":\"Ugh...

But as Xinyan would say to those tied down by worldly worries:<br/>\\\"If you know how to rock, then it's easier to roll.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan does not adhere to traditional performance norms at all. Anything can be used as her instrument.<br/>The pillars on-stage, the floorboards, the cheers and yells of the audience, and even the explosions and sparks created by her Vision are valid brushes with which she paints her performance.<br/>The impromptu stage often starts to burn somewhere after the halfway mark of the performance, till all that's left is a smoking pile of charcoal.<br/>After many warnings, the Millelith were finally forced to tighten their patrols and try to find ways to stop Xinyan from staging her performances.<br/>The subsequent battles of wits tended to turn out in Xinyan's favor — she was often able to find a place to perform, set up a stage with frightening speed, and begin a raucous night with her audience.<br/>The more reliable word on the street is that many patrolling Millelith were themselves infected by the \\\"spirit of rock 'n' roll,\\\" becoming her loyal fans in the process.<br/>Xinyan would get wind of the Millelith's latest patrol plans from these \\\"friends of rock,\\\" and was thus able to avoid their eyes with ease.<br/>Eventually, tiring of the lack of results, and in the absence of any evidence that anyone was harmed during Xinyan's performances, the Millelith came to adopt a \\\"one eye open, one eye shut\\\" approach to her actions.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan is tall, has a sharp gaze, and always wears her stage costume in public to keep herself in the right mood for her music.<br/>In the eyes of bystanders, this makes her quite the imposing sight as she walks down the street, and many assume she means trouble.<br/>When she lines up to buy a snack, people in front of her in the queue will panic and move well out of her way.<br/>If she happens to lock eyes with a young child, even for a brief moment, they will run crying to their parents.<br/>Even when she has done nothing at all, Xinyan is often suspected of wrongdoing, purely because her fierce appearance makes her look like some sort of heinous villain in the eyes of some people.<br/>Xinyan didn't care all that much about how other people saw her, but she did think that it wasn't a good thing to scare others and make trouble for them, if she could at all help it. Thus, she constantly looked for ways to make a change.<br/>Every day when she woke up in the morning, she would look at herself in the mirror and massage her face with her fingers to stretch and relax her eyes a little.<br/>She would even practice smiling and study expressions — verbal and facial alike — of great elegance.<br/>After a significant amount of practice, she once came across a group of children bullying another child, and instinctually she went over to rescue the bullied child.<br/>She gave the kid what she thought was a friendly smile and a gentle pat on the head. To say that the upset child quietened down after this would not be incorrect...<br/>However, the reality of the matter was that the child was stood there frozen in fear as urine dribbled down their pants.<br/>As for the would-be bullies, they screamed and fled in panic.<br/>\\\"Run! Run! The angry lady's turned into a monster! Sh—She's gonna eat us all!\\\"<br/>\\\"Hey!!! I ain't gonna eat y'all! ...And I ain't no monster, either!\\\"<br/>But it was to no avail. The moment she raised her voice, all her hard work was undone.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan has one standard by which she judges all things: is it or isn't it \\\"rock 'n' roll?\\\"<br/>All that is just and upright — standing up for those who have been wronged, taking on challenges — is \\\"rock 'n' roll,\\\" and all that is reprehensible — fearing the wicked, oppressing the kind, dirty tricks, scheming ways — is \\\"not rock 'n' roll.\\\"<br/>Rock is the spirit of rebellion and resistance, yes, but patently immoral acts are nonetheless \\\"not rock 'n' roll.\\\"<br/>Xinyan reserves the right to make these judgments, and whether these judgments are based on results or her mood, the difference between the things covered by these two opposing terms is clear.<br/>The only catch is that these standards sound odd in certain contexts.<br/>Due to her fierce appearance, Xinyan nearly has no friends, with Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant being one of the few exceptions with whom she can speak most freely.<br/>Xinyan has a special reason for coming to Wanmin Restaurant — for musical inspiration.<br/>Whenever Xiangling is researching new recipes, others may run for the hills, but not Xinyan. She intentionally eats all the experimental products, and amid the taste bud explosion that results from the never-before-seen flavors, inspiration flows into her mind.<br/>\\\"Tell you what, Xiangling, that dish rocked!\\\"<br/>Though Xinyan considers this to be the highest praise, Xiangling finds it a little hard to be happy about such ratings.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"The eternal subject of rock 'n' roll is resistance.<br/>But the thing that Xinyan resists is not a concrete thing, but rather, the conceptual shackles of \\\"prejudice.\\\"<br/>She was born into a poor family, and her parents placed great stock in her, giving her the best of what little they had in the hopes that she would be able to rise to \\\"become a phoenix.\\\"<br/>Of course, this \\\"phoenix\\\" would have to be something that they would recognize.<br/>But things don't always turn out as planned. Xinyan grew to be taller than most girls, and her looks were far from anything that might be considered \\\"cute.\\\" Nor was she any good at any of the feminine arts, whether it was cooking, chores, needlework.<br/>So, since her childhood was so deeply impacted by such \\\"prejudices,\\\" Xinyan understands how terrifying they could be.<br/>Yet becoming a rock 'n' roll star has not caused her to give up on these other arts.<br/>This is not only because she hates losing, but because she feels that \\\"giving up because you have no talent\\\" is itself a prejudiced belief.<br/>Not long ago, a fan of Xinyan's named Yun Jin was invited to her place as a guest.<br/>But if Xinyan hadn't opened the door herself, Yun Jin would have thought that she had the wrong house.<br/>The house was spick and span, the windows were clean, and the home ornaments were hand-made and immaculately arranged.<br/>The cooktop was still moist, indicating that someone had been cooking not long before, and there was half-sewn cloth by the bedside that looked much like the decorations Xinyan wore during her performances.<br/>Why, this was practically the room of some refined lady of reputable upbringing, with nary any spirit of rock 'n' roll to be found!<br/>Xinyan was quite worried that this fan of hers would find the difference between their impression of \\\"rock 'n' roll\\\" and this reality too jarring.<br/>Unexpectedly, Yun Jin's support and fandom would only grow more intense after this.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The way Xinyan sees it, many adults fail to realize their potential because they are tied down by prejudice, giving in to fear and endless anxiety.<br/>They do not understand what life is about, or where they are going.<br/>She wrote these thoughts into her songs, but invited scorn from the very same adults. \\\"What does this brat know?\\\"<br/>Even so, Xinyan did not waver. After all, such mockery was born of prejudice towards her age.<br/>And if prejudice were something so easily overthrown, there would be no value in resisting it, would there?<br/>She believes that rock 'n' roll is like a seed. After every performance, some seeds might sprout within the hearts of those adults who listen.<br/>When they wake up the next day, perhaps they might receive some inspiration, or perhaps a change of mood will come over them...<br/>Even if it only changes their thinking a little bit... Perhaps they might find that the real-life troubles they are facing are nothing but a storm in a teacup.<br/>Of course, few people other than her audience and the \\\"friends of rock\\\" would credit this to rock 'n' roll.<br/>But people do nonetheless say this around the tables after tea.<br/>\\\"Well, having a girl who plays rock 'n' roll is pretty interesting, no?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Xinyan's Instrument\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan's main instrument is a hand-made lyre of a very unique design. She based it off the rock 'n' roll instruments that were imported from Fontaine before adding additional modifications based on personal understanding.<br/>For example, she mounted a crescent-shaped axe-blade on the tail end of the instrument so it might serve as a weapon in a pinch.<br/>She also connected it to her Vision, allowing it to spew flames and sparks. Its internals can also spew flame, all the better for it to self-destruct if it falls into the wrong hands, preventing its misuse...<br/>The list of modifications goes on, and they are too numerous to count.<br/>This instrument is thus unique, and its sound profile is also special.<br/>—Sorry, what? What do you mean, \\\"these modifications sound like they have nothing to do with music?\\\"<br/>Sounds like you, too, need to attend one of her performances. You'll understand then.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan was someone who never fit in in Liyue Harbor, and she only found where she belonged when she encountered rock 'n' roll.<br/>But because she lived in a land that had no place for rock 'n' roll yet, she needed to be able to attract enough attention.<br/>She immersed herself in the world of music, looking for a way to move people's hearts. She broke many an instrument and played till calluses formed on both hands, but still, it was unsatisfactory.<br/>\\\"Who'd want to listen to this racket?\\\"<br/>The rotten-tomato reviews she received were starting to get to her. She wondered if she should quit.<br/>Sitting on top of Mt. Tianheng, she looked down over Liyue Harbor. But though the lights lit the streets and alleys of the harbor, they could not light the flame of the spirit of rock 'n' roll.<br/>She considered leaving, to go someplace where rock 'n' roll was appreciated. But would this not be running away? Would it not be a betrayal of rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance?<br/>No, she would not leave. She would become a \\\"flame\\\" that could light Liyue Harbor up.<br/>She started experimenting with the use of fire to move people, adding sparks and explosions to her music.<br/>But this was no mean feat for an ordinary person.<br/>Who knows how many times she must have burnt her fingers or blown her instrument up. But still, she continued to practice every single day on top of Mt. Tianheng.<br/>And perhaps it was that the gods themselves had great expectations of this new form of music that would soon grace the seven nations...<br/>But regardless, the boiling-hot Vision would be the final stroke of perfection.<br/>Xinyan dashed down the mountain and began her very first rock 'n' roll concert in Liyue Harbor.<br/>Thus did her musical journey begin, with showers of sparks and explosions keeping time.\"}]}\n",

Would be all sorts of bad if my guitar got wet.\"},{\"title\":\"When Thunder Strikes\",\"desc\":\"This rain ain't clearin' any time soon... but the show's still on, people!\"},{\"title\":\"When It Snows\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... How do we attract more folks in this weather? Right! How about we stage a rock-till-you-drop snowstorm endurance challenge?\"},{\"title\":\"When the Wind Is Blowing\",\"desc\":\"Ack! Gotta find some cover, quick, or my hairdo's gonna fall apart!\"},{\"title\":\"Good Morning\",\"desc\":\"Mornin'! I was just warmin' my voice up. We're in real good shape today.\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Alright, that's a wrap! *yawns* If there's nothin' else, I'll go take a nap somewhere...\"},{\"title\":\"Good Evening\",\"desc\":\"Almost about to go live over here. You comin'?\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"Me? Oh, I've got a guitar to maintain, tunes to rewrite... I mean, I just got offstage, there's no way I can sleep right now.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xinyan: Frightening\",\"desc\":\"Not afraid of me, are you? Some folks say I've got eyes like knives, that I don't wear my clothes right, that I don't speak right. They give me a pretty wide berth, too. Really, can't a girl sport her own style without bein' looked at like she's some weird creature outta who-knows-where?\"},{\"title\":\"About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll\",\"desc\":\"Rock 'n' roll came to Liyue from Fontaine, so I guess you could call it a new thing. But it's not too hot around here. Most think it's an awful racket not fit for human ears. And that's why I appreciate everyone who does come listen, haha!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: The Audience\",\"desc\":\"You wanna hear me play? Come to the front — it sounds best from there! *clears throat* Alright then, comin' at you from the one and only rock stage in Liyue!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Kindred Spirits\",\"desc\":\"And here I was wonderin' why we got on so well! So you're not from this world, and that's why you don't care for its rules. Now that's how life should be like! Lose the red tape, and live free!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Invitation\",\"desc\":\"I'd sure love to add some extra flavor to my rock 'n' roll. Wanna get on the drums next time? You've got a good sense of rhythm. ...You've never played? Don't sweat it, it's a question of soul, not skill! Give it a go, I just know you'll be great!\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"I'm guessin' that I'm the only person in Teyvat who uses the fire from their Vision in rock performances. Some say I should respect that power more... But the way I see it, the gods gave the Vision to me, so they like my style, don'cha think?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Naming\",\"desc\":\"I made this guitar myself, y'know? Based it off a rock 'n' roll instrument from Fontaine at first, but it stopped looking like the original real fast. I wanted to give it a rad name, like \\\"The Fyre Lyre,\\\" or \\\"The Jadebreaker,\\\" or \\\"The Hill Stiller.\\\" Still, feels like we're missin' something... Any ideas?\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share: Opera\",\"desc\":\"You ever heard of opera? It's what those rich guys listen to at their banquets. It's all tenor this and falsetto that... Gettin' so uptight about music, ugh — it's just not rock 'n' roll.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"My favorite stage outfit's one I made by hand outta Silk Flowers. You must've seen those flowers before, haven'tcha? Passion-red, they are — a perfect match for my music!\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiangling\",\"desc\":\"I have dinner at the Wanmin Restaurant often. If Xiangling's got some time on her hands, we'll chat till it's real late. Eh? You wanna know what I order? See... I actually eat everything she makes. It's never the same thing, and the flavor's different each time, too. Ooh, she's the rock star of the culinary world, she is!\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli\",\"desc\":\"There was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"Y'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so...\"},{\"title\":\"About Baizhu\",\"desc\":\"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations.\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is.\"},{\"title\":\"About Chongyun\",\"desc\":\"He's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!\"},{\"title\":\"About Hu Tao\",\"desc\":\"I've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying \\\"I like people who play with fire, they're good for business\\\" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yun Jin\",\"desc\":\"Tell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xinyan: I\",\"desc\":\"You wanna know more about me? Haha! Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, I guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xinyan: II\",\"desc\":\"Back when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say \\\"that's unladylike!\\\" *sigh* Talk about prejudice.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xinyan: III\",\"desc\":\"Say, do you notice anything different 'bout me today? I did some facial massages to relax my mouth and eyes, and practiced smiling less broadly in front of a mirror for half an hour. So, how'd it go? Do I look a bit less fierce than usual? ...Even scarier? Huh, okay...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xinyan: IV\",\"desc\":\"Thanks for staying to jam with me! It's almost time for lunch. I've brought your share as well! We've got tomatoes, sausages, fried eggs... Say what? I don't seem like the type? H—Hey now, don't you look down on me. M—Making a nice-looking meal was no problem at all!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xinyan: V\",\"desc\":\"I believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces. I'm perfectly capable of living normally. I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?\"},{\"title\":\"Xinyan's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Hobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your heart's content! Haha... Ah, I can never get enough of that feeling.\"},{\"title\":\"Xinyan's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"*sigh* I send children a-crying every time I accidentally lock eyes with them on the road. *sigh* If only there was a way to make me look a little less scary. But I've tried everythin', and nothing sticks...\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"The lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Ahh, oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Not that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of Jewelry Soup, I'd make sure I'd do right by them!\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy birthday! I made some embroidery especially for you. Check it out — I sewed both our images on in the style of Fontaine's dolls. Pretty cute, eh? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Wh—What, it's not that weird that I can do embroidery!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"That's the groove, alright! That's what I'm talkin' about!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"I'm on fire lately. Look out for my next performance!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"With such power, who knows what never-before-seen bangers I'll be able to come up with? Thanks so much! My next work won't disappoint!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"I feel your awesome, overflowing passion! Tell you what, I'll write you a rock song. It'll be your song — and I'll play it just for you!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Feel the beat!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Power chord!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Pyrotechnics!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Time to rock!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Shred 'til I'm dead!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Amp it up!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Time to celebrate!

Not cool.\"},{\"title\":\"Heavy Hit Taken: I\",\"desc\":\"Hey! Not the guitar!\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: I\",\"desc\":\"I'm takin' the stage!\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: II\",\"desc\":\"Aw yeah, rock on!\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: III\",\"desc\":\"Let's jam!\"}]}\n",

Even if the promise he makes is absurd, he will never break it.<br/>Be it exterminating all the dragons inside their lairs, venturing into a domain of extreme danger, or single-handedly overthrowing the territory of a nobleman...<br/>He not only keeps his promises, but does so with finesse and surgical precision. As the Harbingers' vanguard, Childe always appears in the vulnerable underbellies of Snezhnaya's enemy states, striking as a conflict is about to erupt.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Many myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the battlefield since he was 14 years old.<br/>Oddly enough, at that young age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of many forms of martial arts.<br/>But more terrifying than his skill in combat was his passion for it.<br/>Perilous battles would only excite him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more.<br/>Childe's arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience.<br/>On the other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout.<br/>The man is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the praise of others.<br/>Unlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public performances — occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Ice fishing has been one of Tartaglia's hobbies since childhood.<br/>In those days, he was known neither by the names Tartaglia nor \\\"Childe,\\\" as the Fatui call him, but as Ajax, named by his father after some hero's tale. He and his father would cut holes open upon frozen lakes before sitting beside them and tending to their fishing lines.<br/>This was no easy task, and would sometimes take the entire morning.<br/>But whether it was chiseling away at the thick ice or the long waits in between catches, he was always accompanied by his father's unending tales of adventure.<br/>These were stories of his father's adventures from when he was young, and they became the future that Tartaglia secretly envisioned for himself.<br/>So he would pay close attention, putting himself into the shoes of the protagonist of those tales, immersing himself fully in them even as they waited for a fish to bite.<br/>Even after leaving home, Ajax, later to be known as \\\"Childe\\\" Tartaglia, would keep up that hobby of his.<br/>No longer accompanied by the stories of bygone days, fishing instead became an opportunity to train — to hone his endurance, and reflect on combat techniques.<br/>Such long periods of meditation to refine his skills swiftly relegated the question of a successful catch to irrelevance.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Unlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born with his exceptional skills in battle.<br/>But he would never speak to anyone about that critical, fateful encounter of his...<br/>When he was 14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a shortsword and a bag of bread in hand.<br/>That 14-year-old boy got lost in the snowy forest.<br/>Pursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.<br/>There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman...<br/>Or perhaps one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition in this boy's heart.<br/>This darkness was something that the Harbinger Childe could never again delve into.<br/>In those three months, the swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature.<br/>No one knew what happened within that darkness during those three months, nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone.<br/>When his worried mother and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed in this world.<br/>Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his now-rusty shortsword in hand.<br/>This would mark the end of his youth and the beginning of his days as a warrior.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"By the time he returned home, the young man was no longer the same.<br/>He was no longer frightened and hesitant but had become frivolous and confident. He acted as if this world revolved around him, and as if battle existed for his sake.<br/>Conflict often brings about change, and this capricious, incalculable change attracted Ajax like a revolving kaleidoscope.<br/>In the eyes of his father, that third son that he had so worried about had changed for the worse, bringing much uncalled-for havoc to the seaside village of Morepesok.<br/>Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Ajax had become a nexus of strife, for no matter where he went, fights and squabbles would follow — and he reveled in it.<br/>Ultimately, after a huge brawl was pacified with some difficulty and with some near-fatal misses, his father had no choice but to hand his beloved son over for conscription into the Fatui.<br/>He hoped that the strict military training of the Fatui could hone his son's temper, but wound up watching fully-armed troops getting the stuffing beaten out of them by a mere child.<br/>This was a great disappointment to his father, but it also caught the attention of Pulcinella, the 5th Harbinger.<br/>Shocked by Ajax's great strength and curious about how he invariably became the eye of a vortex of discord, Pulcinella inducted Ajax into the Fatui under the pretext of meting out punishment, ordering him to start from the bottom and take up the duty of serving the Tsaritsa.<br/>His insatiable desire for conquest would thus be constantly satiated in fighting for the Fatui, and his ever-burgeoning ego would gorge upon the elation of vanquishing mighty foes...<br/>Until at last, Ajax was chosen to be one of the Fatui Harbingers, donning the mantle of \\\"Childe\\\" Tartaglia and becoming one of the most powerful people in Snezhnaya.<br/>But becoming Tartaglia was far from his end goal. To someone who sought to conquer the world, this was but a tiny step in his journey.\"},{\"title\":\"Tartaglia's Letters to Home\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Dearest Sister, are you all keeping well at home? Has the old man's headache gotten any better?<br/>Please send my regards to our parents and our siblings.<br/>I've sent some wind chill medication over from Liyue Harbor. It's very effective, and will probably keep him from nagging for a while. It should reach you after a few days.<br/>Apart from our father's affairs, I naturally haven't forgotten about gifts for you all.<br/>This letter should come with two kites from Liyue, a rattle drum, two porcelain dolls from Inazuma, and a crate full of various snacks.<br/>And please break it to Anthon that the residents of Liyue are just boring old ordinary humans, like us.<br/>They're not made of stone, and they don't even eat stones.<br/>Do not fret for my sake, Tonia, and refrain from making trouble for anyone at home. I will be home soon. When I have seized the seven stars of Liyue and laid them at the feet of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa, I will take the first ship home, just as I promised — and you know how I always keep my promises.<br/>Yours faithfully, Your loyal knight.\\\" \"},{\"title\":\"Delusion\",\"desc\":\"Tartaglia's Delusion is his old badge of honor and the proof of his strength.<br/>He still remembers with perfect clarity the day when he received his Delusion and ascended to become a member of the Harbingers.<br/>As he stood before the cold, stern Tsaritsa, The Jester, the very first of the Fatui, personally pinned this insignia onto him.<br/>It was his reward for slaying many terrible beasts, and a memento of countless battles.<br/>But it was not this that brought Tartaglia joy, for honor is the natural reward of the warrior.<br/>Nor did he pay any mind to the odd looks his new \\\"colleagues\\\" gave him, for the opinions and bellyaches of others meant nothing to him.<br/>The sight of the Tsaritsa on her lofty throne alone stirred the young man's heart with respect and admiration, not merely because she opened the way for him to find an abundance of looming battles, but also because of the way she looked upon him.<br/>Her gaze was cold but pure, arrogant yet sharp.<br/>She was not only the sacrosanct Cryo Archon but also a true warrior.<br/>Thus did Childe, having received his Delusion, swear an oath of fealty to the one and only Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.\"}]}\n",

Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Weapons\",\"desc\":\"I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Survival\",\"desc\":\"You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our final battle! I won't allow it!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Invitation\",\"desc\":\"Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up.\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share\",\"desc\":\"The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face-to-face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!\"},{\"title\":\"About Skirk\",\"desc\":\"It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli: Pondering\",\"desc\":\"There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli: Challenge\",\"desc\":\"Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to \\\"mortal\\\" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...\"},{\"title\":\"About Tsaritsa\",\"desc\":\"Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.\"},{\"title\":\"About Varka\",\"desc\":\"Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Tartaglia: I\",\"desc\":\"Remember, comrade, one day I will conquer the world!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Tartaglia: II\",\"desc\":\"Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Tartaglia: III\",\"desc\":\"However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings are well... And I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors too.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Tartaglia: IV\",\"desc\":\"Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, \\\"I'm on fire!\\\" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Tartaglia: V\",\"desc\":\"Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive! Hahaha.\"},{\"title\":\"Tartaglia's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.\"},{\"title\":\"Tartaglia's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"My pet peeves? Hmm, well, to be honest, I'm far too busy journeying with you and slaying powerful enemies to dwell on such trifling matters.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy birthday, comrade! Anyone you need knocked off their perch today? Let me know. I'll happily oblige...\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Hohoho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig...\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"\\\"A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it.\\\" Hmm, who was it that said this again?\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Bravo, comrade! Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"Comrade. Make sure you keep training too. Otherwise, who will be left to fight me to the death when the world lies defeated at my feet? Hahaha.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"You're mine!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Ha!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Tidal wave!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: IV\",\"desc\":\"Bring it on!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: V\",\"desc\":\"Who's next?\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: VI\",\"desc\":\"Hah...\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Riptide!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"You can run, but you can't hide!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Shouldn't let your guard down!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: IV\",\"desc\":\"Brace yourself, this is gonna hurt!\"},{\"title\":\"Sprint Start: I\",\"desc\":\"No time to lose.\"},{\"title\":\"Deploying Wind Glider: I\",\"desc\":\"I could get used to this.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Alright, now we're talkin'!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"Not bad...

This means he has a huge stream of revenue and an entire network of information, in the form of tavern patrons' gossip, right at his fingertips.<br/>In a way, he is the uncrowned king of Mondstadt.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"The scent of wine always lingers in the air in Mondstadt.<br/>If one were to follow the scent to its source, one would invariably arrive at Diluc's Dawn Winery.<br/>A wooden plaque proudly announces the winery’s name, and beneath it is written the winery's motto:<br/>\\\"Shine True.\\\"<br/>Most interpret this to mean that the wines are brewed for consistency of taste, with time-honored techniques and that same healthy dose of sunny optimism that the dawn brings.<br/>Meanwhile, the more pragmatic Knights of Favonius are reminded of the long history of mutual support between the winery and the city.<br/>The winery holds festivities from time to time. These events are routinely attended by enthusiastic fathers, eager to introduce their wonderful daughters to the young and single winery master.<br/>This is all highly entertaining to the other guests, who watch on and comment, mockingly:<br/>\\\"We'd much rather Master Diluc stays married to the winery, given how good this wine is!\\\"<br/>Diluc deals impeccably with all situations, no matter who or what comes his way.<br/>Diluc is a fine young gentleman in every conceivable respect.<br/>\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Diluc avoids talking about the past.<br/>\\\"If only Diluc were still a member of the Knights...\\\"<br/>After a few drinks, senior knights will say words to this effect with a sigh.<br/>They refer to events from a long time ago, back when Diluc's father, Master Crepus, was still the owner of the winery. Master Crepus' wish was for his son to become the most esteemed knight of all and safeguard Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.<br/>As per his father’s wishes, Diluc trained rigorously to make himself worthy of the Ragnvindr name. Sure enough, he passed the Knights of Favonius' trials, swore the oath of protection to Mondstadt, and entered their ranks. Before long, he received an early promotion which saw him become the youngest-ever Cavalry Captain.<br/>Over the course of his missions and patrols, the denizens of Mondstadt gradually came to know this young and passionate Cavalry Captain.<br/>No matter what the missions demanded from him, he always maintained his composure and his passion. No matter how big the challenge before him, his boundless courage always led him to the front line. The praise he received from his comrades and citizens spurred him on.<br/>But the words of praise he valued most of all were:<br/>\\\"Good job. Now, that's my son.\\\"<br/>His father's words fueled the fire inside his heart and served as his greatest motivation.<br/>His faith was an unquenchable fire that burned strong and bright inside him.<br/>Diluc was so young back then.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Sometimes, life can change in an instant.\\\"<br/>The day that Crepus spoke these words to Diluc would turn out to be the latter's last as a Knight of Favonius.<br/>For on that day, a horrific monster attacked the transport fleet he and his father were traveling with.<br/>There was no time for Diluc to send for help. The monster was stronger than any foe the young Cavalry Captain had ever encountered, and overpowered him.<br/>Diluc could never have anticipated the way this battle would end: His father, who had been denied admittance into the Knights and who was shunned by the gods, defeated the monster with an unknown evil power — before that same power backfired, mortally wounding Crepus himself. Crepus died shortly after in his son's arms.<br/>With a heavy heart, Diluc returned to the Knights' headquarters, only to receive an unthinkable order from Inspector Eroch: \\\"Conceal the truth.\\\"<br/>Eroch insisted that the incident must be portrayed as an unfortunate accident in order to maintain the reputation of the Knights of Favonius in the eyes of the public.<br/>Such was the sheer outrageousness of this request that Diluc did not think it was even worth trying to argue.<br/>Diluc's father had once said to him that the world would never turn its back on the faithful.<br/>But now, the Knights of Favonius trampled on his faith like it was nothing. He couldn't help but wonder: What was his father's view on faith in his final moments?<br/>Diluc resigned from the Knights that day and left everything behind, including his Vision.<br/>He swore to avenge his father's death, and to find the source of that occult power which had caused his father's demise.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"After Diluc resigned and discarded his Vision, he handed the running of the Dawn Winery over to the head housemaid and left Mondstadt altogether.<br/>Diluc traveled all across the seven nations of Teyvat in search of the truth.<br/>All clues pointed toward a behemoth of an organization: The Fatui. He learned that they made counterfeit Visions in secret, calling them \\\"Delusions.\\\" A Delusion could amplify the power of its bearer to its extreme, but also carried the risk of backfiring. That was what had caused his father's death.<br/>Was it possible that his father could have obtained such a sacrilegious item in order to do good?<br/>Diluc knew he may never know the full truth, but that could never stop him from pursuing it.<br/>Like an eagle scouring the wilderness, he set off on his hunt for the truth. Determination burned like fire in his heart, unfathomable enigmas and unending battles could not sway him from his course. He pressed on relentlessly, scarred but undeterred, like a fiery tornado burning through the dense fog of mystery.<br/>The Fatui's rulers, the Harbingers, monitored Diluc's progress from the shadows. The prowess with which he laid waste to numerous Fatui strongholds caught their attention and forced them to take action.<br/>Diluc narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Harbingers thanks to a third-party observer from the north, who was part of a vast underground intelligence network. The observer claimed to have been watching Diluc for some time, and approved of his methods.<br/>After his close encounter with death, Diluc took a long hard look at his past and the anger he had harbored for so long. Acknowledging his shortcomings, he decided to join the underground intelligence network.<br/>Just like when he first joined the Knights of Favonius, Diluc committed himself fully to his work. His talents and skills saw him rise steadily through the ranks into the upper echelons of the network.<br/>The network was made up of volunteers, and many of its members had willingly given up their prior positions and reputations to join. Some had even abandoned their names.<br/>Could working with these new comrades finally restore the faith he once clung to? The faith that had been all but destroyed in the events surrounding his father's death?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Shine True.\\\" The background to this motto is hotly contested, but to Diluc it has one simple, clear meaning.<br/>\\\"Evil cannot go unpunished.<br/>Never settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come.\\\"<br/>Diluc's solitary sojourn lasted for three years.<br/>Four years on, Diluc had returned to Mondstadt and taken over as head of the family winery, now a young man.<br/>In the space of these four years, Eroch had been purged from the Knights of Favonius after being shown to be a traitor, while Grand Master Varka had left on an expedition, leaving Master Jean to assume the role of Acting Grand Master.<br/>The return of the Dawn Winery's master should have been a momentous occasion for Mondstadt, but strangely it went completely unnoticed.<br/>The reason? Mondstadt's citizens were far too busy pondering the mysterious case of an unknown \\\"Guardian of Mondstadt.\\\"<br/>All that was known about the anonymous guardian was that the smell of burning would follow in his wake, and that a flash of red flames would reveal his silhouette for but a moment in the darkness of the night, before he disappeared in an instant.<br/>The bodies of monsters that had plagued Mondstadt for an age now lay dead in the wilderness... Mondstadt's most wanted thieves suddenly appeared bound and gagged, hanging from their feet in the statue plaza... All the Knights of Favonius were dispatched to reckon, once and for all, with the Abyss Mage behind countless crimes in the city, but they arrived only to discover that he had long since been killed...<br/>Aided by wine-fueled conversations, word of the mysterious guardian spread swiftly, and he came to be known as the \\\"Darknight Hero.\\\"<br/>In public, Diluc appeared to hold this hero in contempt, his face curling up in disgust every time the name was uttered.<br/>Elzer of the Mondstadt Wine Guild was one of the select few who was in the know, and once queried Diluc about this: Was his disapproval of the Darknight Hero just an act, intended to throw the knights off his trail and protect his anonymity?<br/>But Diluc simply frowned once more, and curtly replied: \\\"It's just a stupid name.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Dawn Winery's Apple Cider\",\"desc\":\"Diluc may hold the whole wine industry in the palm of his hand, but he himself is not fond of wine.<br/>At Diluc's request, the Dawn Winery developed several alcohol-free beverages, a decision which was met with resounding approval from those in Mondstadt who could not drink alcohol but still wanted to partake in the drinking culture.<br/>One of those alcohol-free beverages is Mondstadt's apple cider vinegar, the success of which is on a par with dandelion wine in terms of monthly sales volumes.<br/>Some think that Diluc must have such high standards when it comes to wine that he is never seen drinking the mediocre-quality beverages that are available to the public.<br/>Others think that drinking wine must surely remind him of his father, and that that is why he does not touch it.<br/>When pressed about his drinking habits, he responds by saying that alcohol clouds his thoughts, and consuming it would impact his day-to-day work.<br/>But the thing that people don't understand is: What kind of day-to-day work does a winery master do, if it requires him to never touch a drop of alcohol?\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Crepus had two regrets in life. One was never becoming a knight, and the other was never obtaining a Vision.<br/>For this reason, in the moment that Diluc received his Vision, he took it as a recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition — finally, he could make his father proud.<br/>Just a few years later, his father died on a dark and gloomy day. The hopes and dreams that burned bright in Diluc's Vision were extinguished in the torrential rain that fell on that night.<br/>No matter how upright and good-hearted a person may be, death will still come to them without warning.<br/>Is this where the tale of justice ends? Just like that?<br/>It seemed to him that his Vision and his status as a knight were both equally ineffectual at enabling him to protect the things that he treasured most. It was time to discard them both, he decided.<br/>When he recognized his own powerlessness, his Vision became but a burden, of no greater service than a Delusion.<br/>Empty titles were of no interest to him. He sought after ardent flames that would burn brighter than any other, and an unshakable resolve. Only a firm resolve can drive the truth-seeker forward, and only ardent flames can vanquish the ice that freezes the hand of justice.<br/>On the day that Diluc returned to Mondstadt, he took up his Vision once more. The events of his years away had purged him of his childish immaturity, and turned him into a hero ready to shoulder his father's will once more. Each night, from the shadows, he fought for Mondstadt.<br/>He did not discuss the past. But he did not deny the past, either.<br/>To the lost, perhaps a Vision is a beacon of light given by the gods to help them find the path forward.<br/>But to those with conviction, a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far.\"}]}\n",

She bites when piqued, so please be careful.\\\"<br/>Thus did Dr. Edith write of Diona in her notes for \\\"Studies Into Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Diona's appearance did indeed have an impact on Mondstadt's alcohol industry.<br/>The Dawn Winery's long-held monopoly was broken overnight by this unexpected ambush from Cat's Tail, and the man put in charge of the winery's business, Elzer, found this unacceptable.<br/>A calculating veteran of many industrial battles, Elzer considered poaching this key figure, never realizing that Diona considered the Dawn Winery a sort of \\\"final boss\\\" to be defeated in her quest.<br/>\\\"This marvelous and bold method of preparation must be the secret of these flavors, yes?\\\"<br/>Diona simply looked at the white-haired man who had just sat down in front of the bar, rank displeasure in her eyes.<br/>\\\"Ah. Simply exquisite. I can just feel your incomparable passion and love for wine.\\\"<br/>Diona's hand started to tremble as it held on to her cocktail shaker, and detecting the change at once with his sharp gaze, Elzer understood immediately.<br/>\\\"If a brilliant bartender as yourself were to grace the Dawn Winery with your cooperation, we shall be able to bring Monsdtadt's alcohol industry to heretofore unseen heights!\\\"<br/>...When Diluc questioned Elzer as to the story behind his bandaged hand later, he was uncharacteristically hesitant to say anything.<br/>\\\"I... I was bitten by a cat.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"There is a legend about a \\\"spring fairy\\\" that circulates in Diona's hometown.<br/>The fairy once saved a mother and son who had despaired beside a well, filling the barren hole with rushing waters that pooled and formed a spring. The child, deathly ill, was miraculously healed by those spring waters.<br/>Many people came to catch a glimpse of these blessed waters, and built a settlement around it, and left it not thereafter. Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.<br/>Nowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.<br/>Only little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.<br/>These were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful — feelings worth answering.<br/>That was what the spring fairy believed.<br/>So, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.<br/>On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.<br/>\\\"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell. May your cup always run over with the sweet wine of celebration. May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow.\\\"<br/>From that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.<br/>Till today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.\"},{\"title\":\"Cold Cocktail Shaker\",\"desc\":\"Diona's father Draff is also interested in mixing the occasional drink.<br/>Diona's tail would wag from side to side of its own accord as she watched her father rocking the shaker back at forth at night.<br/>But young Diona also found that her father would wind up particularly drunk on such nights, becoming dead to the world before he could even finish her bed-time story.<br/>Thus, when Draff went out to hunt one day, she hid the shaker, squirreling it away in the deepest place under her bed.<br/>Unexpectedly, her father didn't bother looking for the lost shaker at all. He simply brought a new one back the very next day.<br/>When Diona went to Cat's Tail to try out for the role of bartender, Margaret noticed how the cocktail shaker Diona had with her looked wholly unsuited for her style.<br/>Ever skilled with handicraft, Margaret would give Diona a cocktail shaker equipped with a lovely cat's tail as an induction gift.<br/>\\\"Now, this suits you far better,\\\" Margaret said with a satisfied nod.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Diona's antipathy towards alcohol is not \\\"hate\\\" per se. Instead, it can be considered a form of \\\"avarice.\\\"<br/>She wishes for her father to always be the man that she admires, and she treasures every moment that she spends with her family, unwilling to \\\"share\\\" her happiness with the wine.<br/>There was once a storm that lasted for three days, and for those three days, her father, who had been out hunting, did not return.<br/>The awful weather prevented the search parties sent by the Knights of Favonius from making much headway, and soon the dread of \\\"loss\\\" began to hang over Diona like a shroud.<br/>If she could not even stand to \\\"share,\\\" how could she bear having something utterly \\\"stolen\\\" from her?<br/>She burst out the door and into the tempest, and the waters that stood in her path were frozen by some power she did not recognize.<br/>Using her superlative tracking skills, she found her father under a broken gorge.<br/>With the help of the other hunters, she returned home with her father, and only once she realized that he would be fine did she finally smile again.<br/>\\\"Do you... want me to mix you a drink? It'll numb the pain a little...\\\"<br/>That was probably the first time she ever mixed a drink in a normal fashion.<br/>\\\"Ooh, it's so refreshing. It's wonderful! Hahaha—Ouch...\\\"<br/>Getting to drink a cocktail that his daughter had made was probably a better anesthetic by far than the alcohol itself.<br/>Still, Diona gaining power over Cryo did not help reconcile her to wine at all.\"}]}\n",

						"data": "{\"list\":[{\"title\":\"Character Details\",\"desc\":\"Throughout its long history, Liyue has never had a lack of rumors and myths regarding all manner of evil spirits and demons. And regardless of the truth of such rumors, someone has to do something about them.<br/>Chongyun was born into a renowned family of exorcists, and has possessed a natural ability to drive away evil spirits from a young age due to his pure-yang spirit. His powers of exorcism are far beyond the norm: his mere presence is sufficient to scatter evil spirits. <br/>However, this has proven to be an inconvenience for Chongyun himself, for though he has undertaken hundreds of successful exorcisms, he has never come face-to-face with a single ghost or demon.<br/>Chongyun believes in his heart that a true exorcist should exorcize evil with charms and swordsmanship. This natural ability that he has... is just not orthodox.<br/>Therefore, he has dedicated himself to the study of exorcism techniques and martial arts, as well as seeking the haunts of evil spirits to prove himself an able and professional exorcist even without his unique physical condition.<br/>Yet, when will that condition stop being a stumbling block on his path to self-realization?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"When Chongyun first ventured out as an exorcist, there had been much talk of an evil spirit lurking inside Liyue Harbor.<br/>The victim of these hauntings was a woman from a family with a high enough stature to even have a word or two with the Liyue Qixing.<br/>From a time she knew not when, her sleep began to be harassed by sounds that kept her awake, but every time she tried to follow the sound, it would suddenly shift behind her, and begin ringing again in her ears.<br/>This shock caused her unspeakable distress, and she even lost weight for loss of appetite.<br/>Her wealth was enough to hire the best exorcists from all over, but no matter what they tried, they had to retreat empty-handed. And not only did the noises persist, they even grew in boldness.<br/>It was then, just when she had given up all hope, that Chongyun walked through her door.<br/>\\\"I apologize for coming just now, it has been far too sunny lately... I heard that this place houses a very stubborn ghost. Please, leave it to me.\\\"<br/>Then Chongyun brought a chair over, and sat upon it in the middle of the house for a time.<br/>That night, the strange sounds were no more.<br/>The wealthy woman finally had a good night's sleep, and she came running to Chongyun the next morning with an overabundance of gold and jewelry as a reward.<br/>But Chongyun, as was his wont, only accepted his usual fee of a few hundred Mora without an ounce of emotion on his face.<br/>Ever since that incident, Chongyun has found that his reputation precedes him for miles around. He has become beloved in Liyue for his \\\"style and character,\\\" and indeed scholars have given him this appellation: \\\"a heart of clear water, and a face of ice.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"However, calling his mannerisms and style \\\"frosty\\\" couldn't be farther from the truth.<br/>Due to the abundance of yang energy in his constitution, he is constantly troubled by increased body temperature and sudden urges or impulses.<br/>He has tried everything to alleviate the issues both physically and psychologically.<br/>His methods include not drinking hot water, not eating hot or spicy food, wearing light clothes, not getting into arguments, keeping himself from being angered, staying indoors on sweltering days, and always bringing a parasol when on the job.<br/>In short, he attempted to stay away from everything that might aggravate his condition.<br/>Despite all this, his yang energy did not subside a whit.<br/>A little depressed, Chongyun began to wrestle with his own body. When he heard about an evil spirit in Dragonspine, he made for the peak wearing only a shirt.<br/>Though it was hard enough to keep himself warm, he still felt this insufficient. Digging a hole in a frozen lake, he jumped in and soaked in the icy water while waiting for the evil spirit to show itself.<br/>After staying in the lake for half a day, he finally caught a glimpse of his target.<br/>However, after pursuing it down to the mountainside, he discovered it was only a snow rabbit that had been frightened off by his flying swords and floating charms.<br/>The fever that he ran afterward lasted far longer than it would in a normal person.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Chongyun's pure-yang spirit is not only a huge obstacle in his path as an exorcist, but a constant daily hassle.<br/>He must be extra careful to stay away from \\\"heaty\\\" things, to which he is very sensitive, or risk his yang energy and emotions going out of control.<br/>Chongyun's clan once held a celebration party at Wanmin Restaurant. And though he waited until all the dishes had gone cold, he did not expect the tender rice balls to be stuffed with Jueyun Chili.<br/>After but a single bite... Chongyun had no recollection of what happened next.<br/>However, according to the victim, chef Xiangling of Wanmin Restaurant, many unforgettable things happened.<br/>Chongyun first jumped onto the reception desk and shouted, \\\"Everything's on me tonight!\\\" — never mind that he did not actually have any money on him.<br/>He then began to chat with customers at other tables as if they were old pals, bragging to them of how incredible his clan's exorcist arts were, never forgetting to taste other people's dishes on the tables before he left.<br/>Lastly, he claimed to have sensed an evil spirit in Wanmin Restaurant. This he did not find, but he did slap a charm on Xiangling's forehead and chase her around with his sword.<br/>Afterwards, Chongyun scrimped and saved for an entire month to pay Wanmin Restaurant back for the mess and any damages he might have caused; he also gave Xiangling an evil-warding talisman that he carved by hand.<br/>But Xiangling, for her part, didn't mind Chongyun's \\\"transgressions\\\" at all. Instead, she felt that the crazy Chongyun was the real Chongyun, without any personal walls up.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Chongyun has had the privilege of meeting a true friend in his long journey as an exorcist: Xingqiu.<br/>In contrast to the hard-working Chongyun, Xingqiu was naturally gifted, and had a more flexible way of looking at problems.<br/>After learning about Chongyun's troubles, Xingqiu came up with a possible solution.<br/>\\\"If you can't reduce the effects of your yang energy, what if you sought out an evil spirit that is immune to it?\\\"<br/>This was a eureka moment for Chongyun. Since then, Chongyun has no longer sought to alleviate his condition. Instead, he now tries to get Xingqiu to come with him to find such a spirit.<br/>\\\"What? Sightings of the legendary Aoyin near the Sea of Clouds? Leave it to me!\\\"<br/>\\\"The old house at Feiyun Slope has been taken over by an evil spirit? My bad. I'll attend to it right away.\\\"<br/>\\\"A master exorcist is staying over at Wangshu Inn? I could learn a lot from him... Hmm, better go with a gift.\\\"<br/>Xingqiu usually just makes these \\\"leads\\\" up as he goes, and thanks to his \\\"advice,\\\" Chongyun often comes back empty-handed, blaming his bad luck.<br/>\\\"I tried my best to look for it, and even spent quite a sum purchasing more intelligence on that evil spirit — but I wound up missing it by a hair anyway,\\\" Chongyun says, abashed.<br/>If Xingqiu has time to spare when such an occasion arises, he will encourage Chongyun, treat him to some new cold dishes he has found and then set off to get Chongyun's swindled money back.<br/>A warm and reliable companion, indeed! — So Chongyun thinks at such moments. Who could he possibly trust, if not his fine friend Xingqiu?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"In truth, Chongyun wishes that he could fit in more, but he is often forced to reject the invitations of others on account of his need to control his abundance of yang energy.<br/>Of these practices, he finds one particularly incomprehensible: hot springs.<br/>Bathing and \\\"relaxing\\\" in steaming-hot water? Even the sound of that scares him a hundred times more than freezing in a lake on Dragonspine.<br/>However, he has also heard everyone sing yearning praises of these hot springs, praising their comfort, and asserting that they become more so the hotter they are, and that one is filled with energy for a whole week afterward.<br/>Chongyun still doesn't know if this is true or if people are just teasing him.<br/>And he would have dared to try it out, if not for the ever-present problem of his pure-yang spirit.<br/>Xingqiu once asked him this:<br/>\\\"If you were able to master your yang energy and rid the world of all evil spirits someday...what would you do after that?\\\"<br/>This seemingly off-the-cuff remark troubled Chongyun deeply.<br/>Perhaps he had indeed missed out on a lot in life on account of his condition.<br/>But he doesn't regret spending time. If one way of living doesn't work, he just needs to find himself another — and in any case, he already has his answer.<br/>If that day comes, well, he'll go to the hot springs then.\"},{\"title\":\"Field Guide to Demons and Beasts\",\"desc\":\"The tomes that Chongyun's family has passed down from generation to generation detail every evil spirit they have ever subdued.<br/>From little critters to the monstrous demons found in tall tales of horror, their varieties are almost dazzling.<br/>It was one such terrifying story that inspired Chongyun's vow to rid the world of evil spirits.<br/>But as far as he is concerned, inheriting these books has... also proved inconvenient.<br/>Other than textual descriptions, the books also contain illustrations of said evil spirits that carefully detail their unique characteristics — even if the artist may not have been the greatest talent.<br/>But Chongyun has never seen an evil spirit in his life. Unwilling to break with this artistic tradition, he was at a loss.<br/>Ultimately, he would attempt to use his imagination to draw some suitably strange images.<br/>—Thus did the Field Guide to Demons and Beasts grow ever more exotic. Best not to think too deeply about that seven-winged, five-legged chicken-beast or that half-fish, half-hilichurl demon.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Those other exorcists at least have the courtesy to wave their swords or tack on some talismans. You just sat here for a while, and now you say you're done, and that I should pay you? Who are you trying to fool?\\\"<br/>Chongyun faced a great deal of suspicion when he first took up the role of an exorcist.<br/>He immediately faced one big hurdle: it was a lot easier to prove that \\\"evil spirits are present\\\" than not.<br/>Of course he would seem a charlatan even compared to \\\"exorcists\\\" who just went through the motions.<br/>With all the ability in the world but no place to use it, looked on with suspicion, and needing to suppress any passionate impulses...<br/>Those who eventually apologized to him were also few.<br/>But even so, Chongyun would not go with the flow, and use some fancy act to cover for his real method of conducting exorcism.<br/>Even with his unique composition posing countless obstacles for him, Chongyun has never once considered giving up.<br/>One day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.<br/>Perhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor — that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of \\\"Cryo\\\" rather than \\\"Pyro.\\\"<br/>As to which of his goals it was that the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery.\"}]}\n",

There is strength in numbers.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiao\",\"desc\":\"The Conqueror of Demons himself has defended Liyue side-by-side with we exorcists for generations, day after day, night after night. I have the utmost respect for Adeptus Xiao. It's just... Why must he be so disparaging toward us? He says our repertoire is lacking and our power is trivial. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept that.\"},{\"title\":\"About Hu Tao\",\"desc\":\"The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a reputable institution that acts with integrity. But whenever I see that cheeky smile that says, \\\"It's nothing you exorcists need to worry about,\\\" it just makes my blood boil... Whoa, deep breaths, Chongyun. Stay calm.\"},{\"title\":\"About Qiqi\",\"desc\":\"She looks like a zombie, but as an exorcist, I feel there's... something different about her. Hmm, her name is also absent from all the praised names I've seen... Where exactly does she fit in among the deities?\"},{\"title\":\"About Xinyan\",\"desc\":\"I avoid Xinyan's performances like the plague. That heated atmosphere... Even if you don't intend to get involved, it still... Let's just say that it gets me all hot and bothered.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiangling\",\"desc\":\"Xiangling's cooking is universally praised, but I personally don't touch any of her spicy dishes. Why? Oh, you know — just, uh... personal preference, that's all. I mean, come on, Mushroom Slime Stew... Does that sound appetizing to you?\"},{\"title\":\"About Shenhe\",\"desc\":\"The elders in my clan have mentioned her before. The fate of her family... *sigh* It's something we can all sympathize with. I originally thought we would be able to bring a long-lost relative back into our clan. The elders were overjoyed, too, when they heard she was still alive — they even prepared gifts for her, and picked an auspicious day for a grand reunion. What we hadn't counted on was that most of the time, she's extremely difficult to track down. Wait a minute, based on our relative positions in the family tree, does that mean that I... There's no way I'd have to call her \\\"Auntie Shenhe\\\"... right?\"},{\"title\":\"About Yelan\",\"desc\":\"I met her once, back when I'd just become an exorcist. I'd taken a commission to perform an exorcism in someone's home, and was just leaving at the end when I ran into her. She wrote my name down in a booklet — I guess she just wanted to confirm I wasn't doing anything suspicious... Anyway, it was just that one time, I never saw her again after that.<br/>Now that I think about it, it's probably because the sight of me meditating motionless must be pretty boring to watch. Not exactly suspicious.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Chongyun: I\",\"desc\":\"Discipline is everything. Unbridled passion can have disastrous consequences. Trust me, I would know. ...Oh, no no no, not from personal experience, of course. Haha... Uh... I'm just stating my observations from what I've seen in my travels around Liyue.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Chongyun: II\",\"desc\":\"I was born with something called congenital positivity, meaning I have too much positive energy... Apparently it's so rare it only happens once every thousand generations or so. It means I repel all evil for miles around... *sigh* Actually, that's a bad thing. I must be the only exorcist in history who can't get within ten miles of an evil spirit.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Chongyun: III\",\"desc\":\"One of the main symptoms of congenital positivity is excess passion, something which has gotten me into many embarrassing situations. In an effort to alleviate these symptoms, I have to abstain from eating chilis and all hot food. I also have to take a parasol with me everywhere, and I avoid listening to rousing music. I wonder, will I ever overcome my condition for good?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Chongyun: IV\",\"desc\":\"Waiting for evil to show up at the doorstep will get you nowhere — you have to go out and hunt it down. By purging Liyue of evil spirits, I bring peace of mind to people and also broaden my horizons. If an evil spirit ever bothers you, just let me know. I'll come and help you out right away.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Chongyun: V\",\"desc\":\"To permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist. If that grand day ever comes, I suppose I should be able to consider trying many new things, such as hot springs, Jueyun Chilis, and... partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature. Ugh, what am I doing... Ugh, I shouldn't be dwelling on these things, even thinking about them is too stimulating for me...\"},{\"title\":\"Chongyun's Hobbies...\",\"desc\":\"I like listening to Tea Master Liu's stories. His narration really brings the hair-raising tales of the supernatural to life. Why not come with me some time?\"},{\"title\":\"Chongyun's Troubles...\",\"desc\":\"After making numerous inquiries and putting in an enormous amount of effort, I finally tracked down the location of an old haunted temple. So I camped out there for four whole days, ready to exorcise the hell out of that place... and nothing happened. Not even the faintest glimpse of an evil spirit. *sigh* Sadly, this is a regular occurrence for me.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Nothing makes me happier than sitting down to an authentic Inazuman meal, ingredients imported of course. After training hard all day, the ice-cold freshness of Inazuman cuisine takes the exhaustion away.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"Anything piping hot and laden with chilies is an absolute no-go for me. The mere thought of a Jueyun Chili gives me hot flashes.\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"On the anniversary of your birth, please accept this gift of a flower, made of ice crystals. I carved it myself. If you ever encounter an evil spirit, cast this toward it — the spell I have cast upon it will immediately come into effect and hopefully get you out alive. Also... Happy birthday.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"We often use these materials for thaumaturgy during exorcisms — I never knew they could be used to purify one's own spirit, too.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Martial arts and thaumaturgy are alike in that there are always new dimensions to explore. Thanks to your guidance, I can see myself making progress.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Never before have I fathomed such lofty heights of martial prowess! For eye and hand, man and blade to act in unity... Truly, I have been enlightened.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"With all the secrets arts that I have learned, my goal of banishing all evil from the world is finally in view. I will never forget how much you have done for me. Maybe now I even have what it takes to face the flames of my positive energy, and see if I can take the heat.\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"A touch of frost!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Forth, my blade!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Swift and merciful!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: IV\",\"desc\":\"One with my blade!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"From whence you came!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: II\",\"desc\":\"Spirit blade, attack!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: III\",\"desc\":\"Submit for judgment!\"},{\"title\":\"Deploying Wind Glider: I\",\"desc\":\"I ride on wind and cloud alike.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: I\",\"desc\":\"Hmm, objects like this may prove useful when purging evil spirits.\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: II\",\"desc\":\"It was worth the trouble!\"},{\"title\":\"Opening Treasure Chest: III\",\"desc\":\"Unexpected, but welcome.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: I\",\"desc\":\"Barely a scratch.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: II\",\"desc\":\"I cannot underestimate my enemy.\"},{\"title\":\"Low HP: III\",\"desc\":\"Curb your fury!\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: I\",\"desc\":\"After all that training...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: II\",\"desc\":\"The scourge of evil remains...\"},{\"title\":\"Fallen: III\",\"desc\":\"This spells the end of the exorcists...\"},{\"title\":\"Heavy Hit Taken: I\",\"desc\":\"But how!?\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: I\",\"desc\":\"Present.\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: II\",\"desc\":\"My demon-expelling mantra is ready.\"},{\"title\":\"Joining Party: III\",\"desc\":\"Time for some training?\"}]}\n",

However, Hu Tao, the current owner of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, primarily focuses on the art of sending mortals on their way.<br/>For the various ceremonies for sending adepti off, Hu Tao usually employs the help of a friend in more or less the same business. That person's name is Zhongli. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts. This is not something one would likely witness twice in their entire lifetime.<br/>Not even the most particular and learned of researchers or scholars could find one fault in Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's ceremonies for sending adepti off.<br/>Everything must be perfect, from the costumes, the time, the place, the items, the weather, the scheduled length, the size of the permitted audience, to the stature, profession, and age of said audience. Nothing can be overlooked.<br/>When folk describe Zhongli as \\\"living history,\\\" the latter usually only smiles and sighs.<br/>\\\"I... just have a good memory.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"In Liyue, if a person pays great attention to details, and has insuperable criteria by which they judge certain matters, then they are called \\\"particular.\\\"<br/>In truth, everyone is \\\"particular\\\" about something. Some people hate spicy food, others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...<br/>But as for Zhongli, he is particular about everything.<br/>He attends operas performed by only the most celebrated stars, takes only the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and he goes into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of shrimp and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.<br/>Zhongli has expertise in all manner of things, from fashion to daily essentials, to fine wines and delicacies, to teas and spices, and to flora and fauna. He is also more than capable of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.<br/>But on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia, because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"When making a purchase, look to haggle.<br/>This is a common understanding among the people of Liyue. No matter what high heavens the store owner praises their product to, no matter its ancient history or classical value, prices are always flexible. Half the stated cost is a good place to start.<br/>But when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls for someone else to pay up on his behalf), he never looks at the price tag. As long as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even buy it at a premium sometimes.<br/>But for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring money.<br/>For small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he somehow finds ways to have written off.<br/>To those merchants who secretly pride themselves on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human condition.<br/>Or perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.<br/>How has such a person not died of hunger yet?\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"There is no way Zhongli can starve.<br/>Such concerns as profit and loss are beneath his notice. The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.<br/>As for wealth... He is wealth itself.<br/>He is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue, and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat, Mora, is named after him.<br/>When night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his own hands.<br/>To the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.<br/>When he laid down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of Commerce.<br/>He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so historians call him the God of History.<br/>Thousands of years ago, the forebears of the citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.<br/>People from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.<br/>But in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.<br/>The delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"As the founder of Liyue Harbor, \\\"contracts\\\" are the most important thing to Morax.<br/>From simple monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down, there is no part of city life untouched by \\\"contracts.\\\"<br/>To merchants, \\\"contracts\\\" are the most important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.<br/>Thus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.<br/>Through the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as \\\"permissible if unaddressed,\\\" and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.<br/>Amid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.<br/>The person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the \\\"Tailor of Liyue,\\\" in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.<br/>But no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.<br/>\\\"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"Rex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.<br/>Rex Lapis still remembers that moment when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods. The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding humanity.<br/>As time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.<br/>The carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest of The Seven.<br/>When Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.<br/>So when Barbatos descended in a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what help he may.<br/>But as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.<br/>\\\"Here's some wine from Mondstadt. Care for a taste?\\\"<br/>To forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous notion!<br/>Yet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.<br/>From then on, the first Seven would often gather in Liyue.<br/>Rex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.<br/>The world has changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.<br/>The seven seats changed and again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.<br/>Nor would the duty of guiding humanity be honored by the new archons.<br/>Even the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.<br/>Nor would the wind ever return again.<br/>One drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,<br/>\\\"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call it a day.\\\"<br/>Long did he stand amidst the milling crowd.<br/>\\\"Have I... already finished my duties?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"That Which Rises From the Sea\",\"desc\":\"During the Archon Wars, every corner of Teyvat was consumed in the fires of conflict. Not only did gods fight amongst themselves, but countless wicked things also sought to expand their domains.<br/>One such type of creature caused no end of woe for the Geo Archon, long before he took that title along with his place among The Seven.<br/>These foul creatures, straight from the murky depths of the ocean abyss, had a squishy exterior, and possessed agile tentacles that would live on even after being cut off, even secreting some thick and revolting fluid in the process.<br/>This alone would have been enough to make them the most monstrous of all creatures, and still it was not the pinnacle of their monstrosity.<br/>What made them so truly terrible was their small size, which gave them the ability to duck into unimaginably small nooks and crannies.<br/>No space was too narrow for them, neither the wooden boards of tables and chairs, nor the seams of windows and doors and curtain folds, nor even books and brushes.<br/>Many a poor soul had, on at least one occasion, unwittingly outstretched their hand, only to quickly retract it in horror with a blood-curdling scream at the sensation of something cold, clammy and damp, while one or more of these despicable creatures came crawling up their arm, leaving a shiny trail behind them...<br/>At the behest of the people of Liyue, Morax agreed to wipe these creatures out. But these parasites upon civilization could not be destroyed like enemies on a battlefield, by simply summoning a storm of stone spears that would shatter the earth and churn the soil....<br/>Still, he was the God of Contracts. His word had to be his bond.<br/>So, he went through the town from house to house with prisons of stone, seizing these creatures one by one and locking them away for good...<br/>This long campaign of pest extermination taught Morax the true meaning of \\\"a burden lifted.\\\"<br/>The grueling campaign itself, and the terrible smell of those ocean creatures' secretions, left a lasting impression on the deity.<br/>Today, even when he goes out incognito as the mortal man, Zhongli, Morax gives those living, squirming seafood products a wide berth.<br/>...Well, except for dishes where said seafood products have been sliced and diced into oblivion, such as seafood tofu. He'll quite happily eat those.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Once the Rite of Parting, of which Zhongli was both director and star, was over, the Fatui Harbinger named Signora appeared before him.<br/>By prior contract, she was here to claim the Geo Archon Morax's Gnosis.<br/>Before the Traveler and the two Fatui Harbingers, Zhongli related the truth that he had established a contract with the Cryo Archon.<br/>In his own words, this was his final \\\"Contract to End All Contracts.\\\"<br/>Yet no matter how one looks at it, the loss of his divine ability to defend Liyue was too great a price to pay.<br/>Even amongst mortals, the basis of a contract is \\\"equivalent exchange.\\\"<br/>And for the God of Contracts, who must have established countless such agreements in his long years of existence, such an important contract must have come with its benefits.<br/>Now, the Geo Archon has given away his Gnosis as his part of the deal.<br/>What, then, must the Cryo Archon have wagered to balance the scales?\"}]}\n",

The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.<br/>\\\"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!\\\" Or so most alchemists would protest.<br/>But as far as the average citizen of Mondstadt was concerned, that was alchemy.<br/>At least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.<br/>This young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the Sumeru Academia did not possess.<br/>\\\"The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life.\\\"<br/>As if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.<br/>Seconds later, a Cecilia sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.<br/>\\\"And this... is new life.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Albedo has a very important job within the Knights of Favonius but does not often appear in public.<br/>Still, he does not have the strange and eccentric temper that people tend to assume of academics. In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.<br/>He is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.<br/>As a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.<br/>On days when he shuts himself away in his laboratory to focus on his work, or heads out into the wild to gather materials, no one in Mondstadt will be able to find him.<br/>Yet Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.<br/>He delights in giving guidance to his assistants, Timaeus and Sucrose.<br/>He finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.<br/>Yet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that Lisa, for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Albedo got into Mondstadt because of his master's recommendation letter.\\\"<br/>This statement is technically true. But Monstadt's gates are open to everyone, and he would have been quite welcome even without the recommendation letter.<br/>In fact, Albedo's life in Mondstadt may even have been more comfortable without it.<br/>This is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer, Alice, an old friend of Albedo's master, Rhinedottir.<br/>After receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.<br/>\\\"So, Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!\\\"<br/>And just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.<br/>The work of the Knights was actually quite easy for Albedo, requiring only five percent of his energy.<br/>The rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal, he thought.<br/>And yet...<br/>Alice has a daughter, named Klee.<br/>Yes, \\\"that\\\" Klee.<br/>\\\"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!\\\"<br/>From that day forth, cleaning up after Klee would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Albedo has no memory of any blood relations. From as far back as he can remember, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.<br/>Of course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them... They are all important people. And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.<br/>For Albedo, she is his only kin.<br/>She was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.<br/>\\\"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...<br/>Chalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life. And this...\\\"<br/>She demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.<br/>\\\"...This is new birth.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Albedo once led a simple and content existence.<br/>There was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.<br/>But one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.<br/>And with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.<br/>Upon the note was written: \\\"Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment.\\\"<br/>The classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master's collection.<br/>If one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.<br/>In the past, Albedo's assignments had always been very difficult.<br/>He had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.<br/>But this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.<br/>Did this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?<br/>\\\"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"The alchemy that Albedo commands is wholly different from any of the arts practiced in the Seven Nations of Teyvat.<br/>Its lineage can be traced back to the nation of Khaenri'ah.<br/>Khaenri'ah was an underground realm, with precious few natural fauna. As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.<br/>This art of creation was known as \\\"The Art of Khemia.\\\"<br/>Albedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.<br/> The next stage after \\\"soil\\\" is \\\"chalk,\\\" which was also something his master had mentioned.<br/>\\\"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man.\\\"<br/>Now, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.<br/>\\\"From soil was birthed chalk.\\\"<br/>The profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.<br/>Such ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.<br/>She was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.<br/>\\\"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?\\\"<br/>From time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.\"},{\"title\":\"Albedo's Artwork\",\"desc\":\"Albedo's interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master.<br/>At first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.<br/>Additionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.<br/>Eventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.<br/>When strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.<br/>Sometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.<br/>Albedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.<br/>How was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?<br/>Amazed, he decided to give it a go himself.<br/>...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, \\\"A Legend of Sword\\\" was printed and published.<br/>Unfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as \\\"a dictionary with divine illustrations.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"Gaining a Vision came as no great surprise to Albedo.<br/>When he received it, he gave it a single glance before continuing to engross himself in his work.<br/>He barely felt any wave of emotion at all, as if this was something to be taken for granted.<br/>As far as he is concerned, his Vision is merely a tool with which he can more conveniently conduct his research.<br/>What truly sparks joy within him is turning the unknown into the known.<br/>One day, he will understand all there is to know about this world — and Visions are no exception.\"}]}\n",

But I don't think I'm any \\\"genius.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"About Albedo: Socializing\",\"desc\":\"Relationships are... *sigh* quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires...a lot of time.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Experiments\",\"desc\":\"You... want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored.<br/>Oh, don't be nervous. My experiments may be dangerous, but no one gets hurt... most of the time.\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Assistant\",\"desc\":\"Would you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents.\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"My Vision?

Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height? Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots — if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours — you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable.\"},{\"title\":\"About Family\",\"desc\":\"Family? Although Alice has always asked me to call her \\\"Mother,\\\" when I think of the idea of \\\"family,\\\" my master comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words \\\"family\\\" and \\\"master\\\" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sucrose: Direction\",\"desc\":\"Sucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors.\"},{\"title\":\"About Sucrose: Habits\",\"desc\":\"Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me \\\"Albedo\\\" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. *sigh* ...Whatever she prefers, I guess.\"},{\"title\":\"About Lisa\",\"desc\":\"Lisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.\"},{\"title\":\"About Klee\",\"desc\":\"Indeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice.\"},{\"title\":\"About Jean\",\"desc\":\"Jean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master. One can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself.\"},{\"title\":\"About Xingqiu\",\"desc\":\"Oh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?\"},{\"title\":\"About Barbara\",\"desc\":\"Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Albedo: I\",\"desc\":\"Have a question for me? Go ahead, ask.

Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?\"},{\"title\":\"More About Albedo: III\",\"desc\":\"The time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya — one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Albedo: IV\",\"desc\":\"What do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Albedo: V\",\"desc\":\"Even now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over. I will require your help to investigate further.\"},{\"title\":\"Albedo's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Hmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax.\"},{\"title\":\"Albedo's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"There's just never enough time, is there? Even when I remove the most troublesome matters from my schedule, I still can't find enough time for everything.\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost.\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"What food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food...\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Happy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch.\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Nigredo is the first step in alchemy, drawing from primordial forms.

He lives in Wolvendom and is rarely spotted by the citizens of Mondstadt.<br/>According to a handful of eyewitness accounts, Razor has keen senses and is highly agile, traversing the forest at breakneck speed. He is often seen in the company of his wolf pack, while generally avoiding contact with humans.<br/>Some speculate that he was an orphan raised by the wolves, while others say he is a wolf spirit that has taken on a human form.<br/>Such rumors only add to the mystery of the \\\"Wolf Boy,\\\" as the denizens of Mondstadt call him.<br/>Meanwhile, Razor the Wolf Boy stands all the while on the hilltops with his head held high, basking in the warm sunlight.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"Razor lives among the wolves night and day.<br/>All of them are as close with Razor as they could possibly be. Which wolf has the loudest howl, which wolf runs the fastest, which wolf is the best at ambushing — there isn't a wolf Razor doesn't know.<br/>He can sense the mood of the wind, smell a scent from miles away, and knows many practical applications for plants of all kinds. The one thing he can't bring to mind is the faces of his parents.<br/>What kind of people were they? No matter how hard he tries, he cannot remember.<br/>His memory starts after his life with the wolves had already begun. The wolves took him in as part of their \\\"Lupical\\\" — a word he was taught by someone else, which means family.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Tiny singing things are flying in the sky.<br/>The clouds are long and fluffy, like a wolf's tail.<br/>Razor's world is a simple one.<br/>On a sunny day, you run around hunting or try and beat your prey to the ripe fruits, on a rainy day, you hide out in a hollow tree and fall asleep hugging a furry lupine friend, with some grass and leaves for a pillow.<br/>Eat as much as you can and drink plenty of water. Cool off in the lake when you're hot, and go find some juicy berries when you're thirsty.<br/>Razor looks at his body and then at the bodies of his kin.<br/>He knows he is different from them.<br/>But there's nothing wrong with that, as far as Razor is concerned.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"One day, a tall man came to the mountains and disrupted Razor's peaceful life.<br/>Razor did not know who the man was, only that he was a human. Seeing the confused look on Razor's face, the man gave him a friendly smile.<br/>\\\"Hey buddy! Why don't you come back down to Mondstadt with me?\\\"<br/>The man offered his hand to Razor as he spoke.<br/>But neither Razor nor the wolves understood the gesture. Feeling protective, the wolves placed themselves between Razor and the man to keep him away.<br/>Razor ducked down beneath the wolves' furry tails. He looked at his body, and then peered out through the gaps in the wolf fur to get a look at the man's.<br/>Razor knew he wasn't the most intelligent of beings, and was at a loss to answer the question that has been in his mind ever since that day.<br/>\\\"Am I a human, or a wolf?\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"It was that man who gave Razor his name.<br/>The simple Wolf Boy could not understand the intricacies of human language, but he knew from the look on the man's face when he produced this sound that the man was giving him a name.<br/>\\\"Rae-zer.\\\"<br/>The shadows cast by the trees of Wolvendom grew short, and then grew long again.<br/>The man taught Razor how to swing a sword. Unwieldy though this steel claw may be, thought Razor, it was at least sharp enough to cut through tree branches.<br/>\\\"Now you can protect your friends.\\\"<br/>\\\"Fr-ren-dzz...\\\"<br/>Razor imitated the sounds the man made, without understanding what they meant.<br/>Similarly, he did not understand why the names of things were all that important in the first place. After all, he never learned the name of that man before he left.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"\\\"Master, what is... 'friends'?\\\"<br/>Razor once asked of his new mentor, working at the limits of his vocabulary.<br/>His purple-clothed mentor seemed to know it all, from how to make hash browns from potatoes in the ground, to the name of the brightest star in the summer night sky.<br/>However, Lisa simply smiled and yawned without answering him.<br/>Razor thought about it when the wind blew, when the rain fell — even when Wolfhook berries got stuck in his fur. He just couldn't figure it out.<br/>Until one day, Razor met a bright-red, 'burny' girl.<br/>They stood in the wind together, got soaked in the rain together — she even rolled around in Wolfhook bushes with him.<br/>Her name was Klee. When Razor played with her, it was like being a wolf pup again.<br/>\\\"Friends... is... Lupical.\\\"<br/>Razor may not understand the complexity of human relationships, but he has an honest, primal loyalty to him.<br/>\\\"So... protect friends... Lupical... with life.\\\"<br/>The wolf pack howls in the distance, summoning him home.<br/>Razor still does not know if he is a human or a wolf.<br/>But he is happy either way.\"},{\"title\":\"Razor's Crude Wooden Crate\",\"desc\":\"In a box so crudely made that one has to be extra careful when opening it lies Razor's greatest treasures.<br/>The broken-off hilt of a greatsword, a children's storybook called The Wolf and the Windwheel Aster, and a dry, withered four-leaf clover.<br/>Though he understands neither the intricacies of human relations nor the ways of the world, Razor knows that these are gifts from the ones known as 'friends' — and that is what makes them his most treasured possessions of all.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"The story of how Razor got his Vision is one of the few memories that he wishes he could forget.<br/>One day, during a lightning storm, an Abyss Mage ambushed Razor from behind and dragged him away. The wolf pack ran to his aid and put up a fearless fight, but every last one of them was defeated by the Abyss Mage.<br/>As he looked on helplessly at his dear companions being harmed, Razor let out an almighty roar like that of a cornered animal.<br/>\\\"Lupical!\\\"<br/>Fueled by his almighty fury, a lightning-like power grew inside, and suddenly an overload of elemental energy was flowing within him.<br/>He was ready to protect. He was ready to avenge.<br/>He threw off his shackles and raised his weapon.<br/>The Abyss Mage was overwhelmed and defeated by a wild, unfettered frenzy of Electro energy, but this time it was too late to save Razor's wolven companions.<br/>...<br/>Though he had obtained a Vision, Razor was still unable to manipulate Electro energy with finesse. One day many moons later, when he met the Witch of Purple Rose, Lisa, he began to study human knowledge.<br/>\\\"Friends, hurt... Never again! I will... protect them.\\\"<br/>With each day, Razor grew more skilled in the use of his Vision. He made a silent promise to himself: \\\"I will become stronger. I will become the strongest of them all.\\\"<br/>Because the day may come when his Lupical faces another threat, and this time, he will protect them.\"}]}\n",

This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.<br/>The world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.<br/>Babes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.<br/>When young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the giant snake.<br/>Soldiers take to the battlefield with \\\"glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\\\" upon their lips.<br/>The people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.<br/>The great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.<br/>People trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.<br/>This is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"The true name of the Raiden Shogun is \\\"Raiden Ei.\\\"<br/>In her long road, she has witnessed the price that Inazuma has had to pay for progress over the hundreds and thousands of years.<br/>The happiest years of her life had passed her by, and those she once considered friends became her foes. In the end, she even lost the reason for which she had wielded her sword.<br/>\\\"Where there is progress, there must be loss.\\\"<br/>Ei believed that this was the iron-clad rule of the world, with time as its merciless enforcer.<br/>The greatest and most prosperous nation of men collapsed overnight, and even that most ancient Liyue Harbor would say farewell to its Geo Archon. The winds of parting came whistling in from the outer edge of time.<br/>However resounding the Raiden Shogun's name, centuries later, millennia later... Someday, Inazuma would lose the protection of its deity.<br/>As a warrior, she was wary of all foes. Even if that enemy was a crisis as intangible as time's passage, she had to find a countermeasure, a weapon she could use to defeat it in time.<br/>Her answer? \\\"Eternity.\\\" Only Eternity could freeze all things under the sky, make Inazuma truly deathless.<br/>\\\"Then, while things are still good, let us have stillness... Let us march towards Eternity.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"For beings with a perishable form of flesh to pursue Eternity, they must first solve the unavoidable problem of lifespan.<br/>This limited time troubled Ei greatly, until one day when a mysterious technique came before her eyes as if by a stroke of fate.<br/>Using such techniques, one could create intricate puppets indistinguishable from true life.<br/>In theory, this puppet could perfectly imitate everything about Ei. It could surpass the limits of her lifespan and defend Inazuma forever. Yet, how could creating a copy of an Archon be a simple affair?<br/>Ei conducted countless experiments to this effect, discarded a great many failed products, and spent an unimaginable amount of time and resources—<br/>But at last, by her dogged pursuit and warrior's spirit, she was able to create a flawless puppet.<br/>The newborn Raiden Shogun sat there silently, listening to Ei speak all about her, \\\"her,\\\" and even about them. The future of Inazuma was here, inscribed upon a gorgeous blueprint.<br/>The automaton had but one question to ask Ei: \\\"There is no turning back from forsaking your form. Do you regret nothing?\\\"<br/>\\\"Your existence is my answer.\\\"<br/>Then, Ei transferred her consciousness into her blade, and thus was born the Plane of Euthymia.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Before Raiden Ei became the Shogun, she was a samurai responsible for seeing that the previous Shogun's orders were carried out.<br/>The previous Electro Archon, Raiden Makoto, was no great fighter, and the things Ei had charge over were mostly matters of warfare and slaughter. However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.<br/>Due to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.<br/>Thus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or Mikoshi Chiyo for karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.<br/>At last, the day came that under a sakura tree's shade, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty tengu would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.<br/>Ei let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.<br/> Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.<br/>As for the Kitsune Saiguu, oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.<br/>\\\"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content.\\\"<br/>Ei was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.<br/>—But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely — just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.<br/>To this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.<br/>...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"Ei still remembers the way in which Makoto greatly loved the scenery of Inazuma, its cuisine, and the stories of its people — and how she loved telling Ei all about them.<br/>Though they both understood the concept of erosion well, Makoto was unlike Ei, who worried about the future more often. Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.<br/>\\\"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more.\\\"<br/>Then, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun. She thought to herself that she must learn to be more leisurely, just like Makoto.<br/>Yet the times changed all too quickly, all but catching Ei off guard. Before she knew it, her hands already held the blade that the dying Raiden Makoto had passed on to her.<br/>This day, the kagemusha was now the true Raiden Shogun.<br/>And it was on this day that Ei truly felt the agony of erosion.<br/>As time marched forward inexorably, even this blade, this sakura... All life on Inazuma would fade before her eyes.<br/>This was the foundation of Inazuma, and it was the thing that the Raiden Shogun must defend.<br/>\\\"If you look at it this way, thinking ahead is not meaningless, nor is it vain arrogance.\\\"<br/>Having resolved herself, her life exceeded its mortal shell, and eternity descended upon the mortal plane.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"One night, Raiden Ei entered a beautiful dreamscape while meditating.<br/>Here, there was nothing left between heaven and earth but her, and a \\\"her\\\" that was akin to looking into a mirror.<br/>The automaton's voice flowed into her ears like a sigh: \\\"the eternity you resolved to establish in your heart has been shaken by the countless wishes of the people. Thus, you have become my enemy.\\\"<br/>Back when she was creating the puppet, Ei had considered all the hidden risks involved.<br/>She believed that anything was possible — including the worst-case scenario... in which she too would someday become a threat to Eternity.<br/>But she had to press on. She had to reach Eternity. This, she would not permit to be stayed by any outside force.<br/>The puppet's words were something that she had asked herself long ago:<br/>\\\"You believe that you are more firmly convicted now than you were yesterday, and that is why you are presently correct. Is that so?\\\"<br/>\\\"Do you presently have some new ideas, or have you, too, fallen victim to inexorable 'erosion'?\\\"<br/>Their faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.<br/>But it was not this day. Ei knew well that she was not yet ready.<br/>Her heart had been clear, and she would have remained in that state, but hearing the cries of her people, she had to command her feet to stop.<br/>The sky above the mirror was no longer empty, and all about the silent halls, she heard the cry of crows. Dawn was coming. The samurai must take up her sword.<br/>This dream was ever so real, and it, too, passed like a shadow.\"},{\"title\":\"Musou Isshin\",\"desc\":\"A sword that, once passed on, has accompanied Ei to this day.<br/>This sword has had two wielders, and has witnessed both time and eternity.<br/>It was born from Raiden Makoto's divine might, but it was never once sharpened. It took after its owner, of course, for Makoto was not one for battle. It was but a symbol, a sign of true peace.<br/>The day Makoto passed on, it was given into Ei's hands. The sword was stained with blood, then, and as the blade drew its first taste of crimson, the dripping ichor was blown aside by wild winds and blazing thunder.<br/>Makoto gave it the name Musou Isshin, and desired to have it witness an Inazuma as lovely as a dream and the noble hearts that dwell in this world.<br/>Ei did not change its name. For she, too, had looked out over that vast scene of beauty, and the sight of it had engendered a stronger, purer dream in her own heart.<br/>The aesthetic of lightning is precisely to capture that which is precious amidst fleeting transience.\"},{\"title\":\"Gnosis\",\"desc\":\"Before she came to dwell in the Plane of Euthymia permanently, Ei was troubled for a time concerning where she might store her Gnosis.<br/>She no longer had any need of it, but such an important item could not simply be placed anywhere. She had initially intended to have it modified into a energy supply device, but no matter what she did, her techniques had no effect on the Gnosis at all.<br/>And that was when she thought of someone: the cunning and clever Yae Miko. She was not precisely someone to be trusted, but she was in many ways also Ei's best choice.<br/>Upon hearing this request, Miko could not help but joke: \\\"Aren't you afraid that I might just sell this off?\\\"<br/>\\\"You understand the value of a Gnosis. Even if you sold it, I trust that you would have exchanged it for something of equal value, and that is no easy price to pay.\\\"<br/>With someone of Yae Miko's character, it would be no surprise if she ever sold the Gnosis, yes, but she would not allow herself to lose out in any such exchange.<br/>Such, then, was the tacit agreement between the two old friends. Yae Miko understood Ei's intent and took the precious Gnosis with a smile.<br/>\\\"Well, this is your idea, not mine. Don't end up regretting this, now.\\\"\"}]}\n",

However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.<br/>To her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.<br/>However, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.<br/>\\\"Good food is good food, period!\\\"<br/>The monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.<br/>It was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.<br/>\\\"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"Xiangling's liveliness is disastrous for the hilichurls of Jueyun Karst.

She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: Black-Back Perch Stew, which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.<br/>Some have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.<br/>\\\"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight.

Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime jus next time.\\\"<br/>Though her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these \\\"special\\\" ingredients into delicious food.<br/>In Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.<br/>Her Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking.\"}]}\n",

I'll whip one up in no time!\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Pyro Slime\",\"desc\":\"I can't decide whether Pyro slimes taste better with salt and pepper or garlic and herbs...\"},{\"title\":\"Chat: Looking for Food\",\"desc\":\"If there's nothing better to do, we could go foraging for ingredients...\"},{\"title\":\"When It Rains: Attitude\",\"desc\":\"Oh... I don't like the rain.\"},{\"title\":\"When It Rains: Negligence\",\"desc\":\"Wait... did I leave my apron outside to dry?\"},{\"title\":\"After the Rain\",\"desc\":\"The rain has stopped! Come with me, let's pick some matsutake.\"},{\"title\":\"When It's Windy\",\"desc\":\"Anemo Slimes always come out in this weather.

Want to get a few cooking supplies?\"},{\"title\":\"Good Afternoon\",\"desc\":\"Lunch is ready!

Well, don't just stand there — dig in!\"},{\"title\":\"Good Night\",\"desc\":\"Hey! You're not sneaking off to get a midnight snack without me, are you? ...Bedtime? Oh. Well, good night then!\"},{\"title\":\"About Xiangling\",\"desc\":\"You've seen the dragon in Mondstadt? How big was it? What!? No way! Imagine how big a steak a dragon that huge would make!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: Strengths\",\"desc\":\"I'm much better at cooking than navigating... but if you do go out, definitely take me with you!\"},{\"title\":\"About Us: New Knowledge\",\"desc\":\"Meeting you has really opened my eyes to things other than cooking. Like what? Well, such as... um... for example... I can't think when you put me on the spot! Forget it, I'll stick to cooking from now on. I have a new recipe for you to try, actually...\"},{\"title\":\"About the Vision\",\"desc\":\"Any time, night or day, I am always willing to make dishes everyone loves. I think the Archons agree with my passion, or else they wouldn't have given me this Vision, something even my master doesn't have... I know they want me to keep going!\"},{\"title\":\"Something to Share\",\"desc\":\"If you get a stomach ache, a cup of herbal tea with Silk Flowers will clear it up in no time! Huh? Of course you can trust my herbal remedies! We chefs are expected to know a thing or two about medicine as well, you know!\"},{\"title\":\"Interesting Things\",\"desc\":\"I love onions! I've tried cutting them dozens of ways, and they still make me cry... No matter, I still love them!\"},{\"title\":\"About Baizhu\",\"desc\":\"I can smell Mist Flowers! It must be Dr. Baizhu! What is he doing here? Uh— Are you okay? Do you feel faint? Is your stomach sore? Or is it a sore throat? I've got it, you're fatigued from all that adventuring! No?... You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would have made you drink some traditional herbal medicine — it's so bitter!\"},{\"title\":\"About Ningguang\",\"desc\":\"That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!\"},{\"title\":\"About Hu Tao\",\"desc\":\"Is Hu Tao picking on you too? Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph. But I can handle it, and she does bring me fermented plum blossoms once in a while so I can make flower cakes... so I don't hold a grudge.\"},{\"title\":\"About Diona\",\"desc\":\"Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me — like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine — all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then.\"},{\"title\":\"About Beidou\",\"desc\":\"Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies. Not just Beidou, but everyone on board The Crux loves my cooking.\"},{\"title\":\"About Zhongli\",\"desc\":\"I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: \\\"It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu.\\\" I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?\"},{\"title\":\"About Chongyun\",\"desc\":\"Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two.\"},{\"title\":\"About Ganyu\",\"desc\":\"Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her — vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yaoyao\",\"desc\":\"Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...\"},{\"title\":\"About Xinyan\",\"desc\":\"Xinyan always comes to the Wanming Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine out of ten times, she enjoys them too! She's great.\"},{\"title\":\"About Yelan\",\"desc\":\"Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilies! Truly amazing.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xiangling: I\",\"desc\":\"Roasted pigeon skewers, anyone? C'mon, it's my secret recipe, you'll love it!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xiangling: II\",\"desc\":\"My master did a good job teaching me spear fighting, don't you think? If you want, I could teach you too. Although... I'd much rather teach you my cooking, if you're interested! I want my recipes to spread all around Teyvat!\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xiangling: III\",\"desc\":\"My heart's desire? To start my very own cooking tradition, of course! Li-style and Yue-style cooking are good, but they have a limited palate. The missing ingredient? Chilli pepper! Come, let me fry up one of Guoba's chilli peppers for you...\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xiangling: IV\",\"desc\":\"I think I've won you over with my cooking now, right? It's time to introduce you to my latest masterpiece — I call it the \\\"most marvelous multi-colored super pancake\\\"! Bright red squirrel ham, orange carrot, yellow sunfrog meat, green calla lily and blue butterfly wings, beautifully wrapped in a thin egg pancake— What? I thought you said you were starving? *sigh* Okay.\"},{\"title\":\"More About Xiangling: V\",\"desc\":\"I'm in a dilemma and I don't know how to solve it... It isn't like me to get so worked up over nothing... Ah! Well, here's the thing. I always love getting you to try my latest recipes, but... I'm worried that my food might not agree with your stomach and... I can't bear the thought of that happening. What should I do?\"},{\"title\":\"Xiangling's Hobbies\",\"desc\":\"Watch carefully! Heat the oil in a pan, then take a handful of crystalflies — wings removed — pop them in, and voila! Delicious deep-fried crystal— Hey! Where are you going?\"},{\"title\":\"Xiangling's Troubles\",\"desc\":\"It's been a month and I still haven't sold a single bowl of Mushroom Slime Stew. Gee, is it just because it looks sticky and gooey? It's their loss if they don't have a spoonful...\"},{\"title\":\"Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"My favorite thing to eat is... whatever exotic ingredient I haven't tried yet! No, I'm not dodging the question, that's my honest answer!\"},{\"title\":\"Least Favorite Food\",\"desc\":\"I'll eat absolutely anything! There are no bad ingredients, only bad cooking!\"},{\"title\":\"Birthday\",\"desc\":\"Ah, there you are! Come with me, I've prepared a birthday feast all for you! ... No really, I insist! Which dish is your favorite? It's okay, take your time, try them all first, then let me know!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Intro\",\"desc\":\"Oh wow! This feels great! My whole body is bursting with energy!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Building Up\",\"desc\":\"Hey! Ha! Hua! I can slay a beast with one punch, locking in that freshness!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Climax\",\"desc\":\"Finally... with this power, I can cook... *giggle* ...Oh no, I've started salivating!\"},{\"title\":\"Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion\",\"desc\":\"As my father always says: \\\"To make a five-star dish, you need ten-star passion!\\\" I know, I know! To be able to come this far is definitely thanks to your ten-star passion when it comes to practicing with me, so I'll be sure to pay you back with two— no, three times the passion!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: I\",\"desc\":\"Guoba, get them!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: II\",\"desc\":\"Nice and spicy!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Skill: III\",\"desc\":\"Out of the frying pan, into the fire!\"},{\"title\":\"Elemental Burst: I\",\"desc\":\"Hey...

He is highly dangerous, and has the most piercing gaze you've ever seen.<br/>He enjoys a formidable reputation and high level of seniority among the adepti, but is relatively unknown in the mortal realm.<br/>This is inevitable. Xiao is not one of those popular deities to whom people pray for wealth and protection, nor is he a mystical sage of Jueyun Karst to whom pilgrims flock in search of divine wisdom.<br/>No... If any mortal witnesses Xiao unleashing his true power, it is certain to be under the direst of circumstances — and they will be extremely lucky if they survive the ordeal.<br/>This is not because Xiao seeks to harm people. Rather, since Xiao wages a constant war against dark forces powerful enough to devour Liyue in its entirety, any bystanders who witness him in the heat of battle are likely to end up as collateral damage.<br/>Not that this is a secret worth going around silencing witnesses for.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 1\",\"desc\":\"What exactly is Xiao wrestling with?<br/>The tactful answer would be old grudges, unfulfilled dreams, the lamentations of the vanquished...<br/>The unmitigated truth is that Xiao fights against the remnants of the defeated gods from the Archon War, which took place prior to the rise of The Seven.<br/>Morax defeated those gods and buried their remains beneath the rocks of the earth.<br/>However, gods are immortal. Their consciousness may diminish, but their power and hatred will always remain and spread like poison, relentlessly stirring up chaos for the world and its inhabitants.<br/>Liyue's rulers, who are aware of the truth regarding Xiao, refer to him in his millennia-long experience as the \\\"Bane of All Evil.\\\" <br/>The war he fights can never be won, and will never come to an end.<br/>It is also an invisible war that no one will ever witness or thank him for.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 2\",\"desc\":\"Xiao is not this yaksha's true name, but a name given to him in the interests of his own protection.<br/>Back in a younger, more naive time, a god had gotten a hold of Xiao's weakness and forced him to serve as their bloodhound, in which capacity he was forced to perform cruel and violent acts.<br/>Many died at his hand, many hopes were crushed, and he was even forced into devouring his victims' dreams. As much as it pained him to do this, he was helpless to resist.<br/>Finally, on the battlefield of the Archon War, Morax, the Geo Archon, had a fateful encounter with the yaksha's master.<br/>The current state of the world has already revealed the results of that battle.<br/>Rex Lapis liberated the yaksha and gave him the name \\\"Xiao.\\\" <br/>\\\"In the fables of another land, the name Xiao is that of a spirit who encountered great suffering and hardship. He endured much suffering, as you have. Use this name from now on.\\\"\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 3\",\"desc\":\"To repay his debt of gratitude to the Geo Archon, Xiao shouldered the burden of protecting Liyue in the millennia that followed.<br/>His past of service under the evil god had rid Xiao of his innocence and gentleness. All that remained within him was the means to kill and the weight of his sins.<br/>The only way he could be of service to mortals was in doing battle.<br/>But what could people do for him in return?<br/>No ordinary person would ever stop to ask such a question. The sight of Xiao, even far off in the distance, was intimidating enough to send people instantly running for their lives.<br/>That said... if ever someone did want to show some appreciation for Xiao, there is perhaps one thing they could try.<br/>There is a certain secret agent of the Qixing who is tasked with supporting Xiao in subduing demons. That secret agent runs a front organization called the Wangshu Inn.<br/>Occasionally, Xiao stops by the inn for a bowl of Almond Tofu, and if you could see the look on his face when he eats it... there's no mistaking it — he clearly loves the stuff.<br/>Nonetheless, it is not the sweet taste that Xiao hankers after. It's the texture he finds irresistible — apparently, it's very similar to that of the dreams he used to devour.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 4\",\"desc\":\"What exactly is Xiao wrestling with?<br/>To those in Liyue's corridors of power, Xiao's battle is against the evil manifestations produced by the remnants of defeated gods.<br/>However, if you asked Xiao the same question, he may well give you an entirely different answer.<br/>Xiao was once enslaved by an evil god and suffered immensely under their rule until finally regaining his freedom thanks to Rex Lapis.<br/>Xiao's powers were highly regarded by the adepti and he seemed to vanquish all manner of evil demons with consummate ease.<br/>But the evil gods also held immense power, and their lust for revenge ran deeper than mere mortals could ever contemplate. Xiao relentlessly slaughtered the endless, impure manifestations of their vengeful souls, but in doing so, he caused them to fracture. Eventually, these fragments of their hatred were able to taint Xiao's own soul.<br/>The only way to eradicate such hatred is to accept the karmic debt it brings. The magnitude of the bad karma Xiao has accumulated over the years is enough to consume flesh, bone, and soul alike.<br/>And yet, Xiao does not feel any hatred. Having lived for over two thousand years, no single karmic debt constitutes anything more than a fleeting memory.<br/>No grudge can last a thousand years, nor is any debt so great that it cannot be paid off in this time.<br/>Xiao has spent many long years alone.<br/>But his battles have never been in vain.<br/>Because ultimately, the one with whom Xiao wrestles is himself.\"},{\"title\":\"Character Story 5\",\"desc\":\"What does Xiao fight against?<br/>The Traveler understands very well that Xiao fights against the darkness that threatens Liyue. He fights to defend Liyue.<br/>But who will defend him?<br/>There was once when most of Xiao's strength was spent fighting from dusk till dawn, with him emerging victorious by a mere hair.<br/>The reeds in the fields had been sliced to ribbons in the fierce fighting. Plucking his spear from where it had been planted in the ground, Xiao began the trek home.<br/>Well, one says \\\"home\\\" — yet, where did Xiao have to return to? He was merely leaving the battlefield.<br/>Long exhausted, Xiao felt the divine hatred that tainted his body take effect.<br/>Limitless hate flooded his senses, and he fell to the ground in agony.<br/>But it was also at that moment that the pain vanished without warning.<br/>This was not by Xiao's own strength, for he had been rescued by the sound of a flute.<br/>The clear, lovely sound of the flute came over the mountains and rivers, carried on the wind to where he lay.<br/>And clear it continued to ring till the first light of dawn brought with it the startled flight of distant birds.<br/>It protected Xiao, massaging his wild senses, and giving him a moment's peace.<br/>Who was playing this music? Xiao was curious but did not pursue the matter. For he already had something approaching an answer.<br/>The last person who could help him was one of The Seven themselves. So this person, too, must be—\"},{\"title\":\"Ode to Windborne Wraith\",\"desc\":\"A scholar of the Sumeru Academia once did folklore studies in Liyue, the result of which was a book called \\\"Tour of the Land of Liyue,\\\" with separate editions being available in Sumeru and Liyue.<br/>\\\"Hidden Diamond and Cloudy Moon: Wonders and Folklores of Liyue\\\" is the version available in Liyue, and has had many mystical and magical portions removed.<br/>The \\\"Ode to Windborne Wraith\\\" is one of the mystical chapters that remain recorded within the complete version at the Academia.<br/>The document mentions that though the yaksha were mighty and upright among the adepti, they were bound by their own karma to suffer great horrors and tribulations. As such, they wandered the land in a state of unending suffering.<br/>The chapter lists many methods of comforting the yaksha, such as food offerings, holy chants, and the like. These would appease the yaksha and help them to continue defending the peace.<br/>As noble warriors among adepti, the yaksha would often descend upon the battlefield in person. However, as conflicts grew over the millennia, they have almost been wiped out. Today, large statues of the yaksha subduing demons remain within Liyue's borders, but they have had their features destroyed.<br/>By the by, the language used in that text was so meandering, and its contents so dense, that it sold far fewer copies than the Teyvat Travel Guide and the international cultural summaries written by El Musk.\"},{\"title\":\"Vision\",\"desc\":\"All adepti are known as the \\\"mighty and illuminated\\\" adepti, and this \\\"illumination\\\" refers to the light of a third \\\"eye\\\" that they possess: a Vision.<br/>But do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from Celestia, like humans do?<br/>Xiao no longer remembers the moment he received his Vision. To humans, this would be an unforgettable event. But for him, this was just the beginning of his endless battle.<br/>The thing that Xiao truly cannot forget is something different.<br/>There are a great many human festivals, and few remember the stories behind them.<br/>The greater part of these days coincide with occasions where man-eating monsters were defeated by the adepti host. People imitated their deeds and staged exorcism rituals to remember their ancient heroism, with these practices eventually evolving into celebratory festivals.<br/>The hatred and residual might of many of the gods defeated by Morax throughout Liyue will sometimes erupt with abnormal force amid their half-awake, half-dreaming state. Among them, the eruption that takes place during the Lantern Rite is the most extreme in scale.<br/>Xiao has his mission to perform the time-honored \\\"Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering,\\\" and so he fights night and day during the Lantern Rite. Thus, he has come to hate it.<br/>Now, Xiao did not consider battle dangerous. It was due to his hard work that Liyue was kept safe. People lit their lanterns, and the blessed lights shone across the night sky and the nearshore.<br/>At that moment, another special feeling blossomed in Xiao's heart. Loneliness? Peace? Or was it his fears for the future? The young-seeming adeptus searched his heart, only to find no answers.\"}]}\n",
